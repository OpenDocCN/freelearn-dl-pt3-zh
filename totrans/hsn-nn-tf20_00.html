<p class="mce-root">Technology leaders are adopting neural networks to enhance their products, making them smarter or, in marketing words, AI-powered. This book is a handy guide to TensorFlow, its inner structure, the new features of version 2.0 and how to use them to create neural-networks-based applications. By the end of this book, you will be well-versed in the TensorFlow architecture and its new features. You will be able to solve machine learning problems easily, using the power of neural networks.</p>
<p class="mce-root">This book starts with a theoretical overview of machine learning and neural networks, followed by a description of the TensorFlow library, in both its 1.x and 2.0 versions. Reading this book, you will become well-versed in the required theory for understanding how neural networks work, using easy-to-follow examples. Next, you will learn how to master optimization techniques and algorithms to build a wide range of neural network architectures using the new modules offered by TensorFlow 2.0. Furthermore, after having analyzed the TensorFlow structure, you will learn how to implement more complex neural network architectures such as CNNs for classification, semantic segmentation networks, generative adversarial networks, and others in your research work and projects.</p>
<p class="mce-root">By the end of this book, you will master the TensorFlow structure and will be able to leverage the power of this machine learning framework to train and use neural networks of varying complexities without much effort.</p>

<p>You need to have a basic understanding of neural networks, but this is not mandatory since the topics will be covered from both a theoretical and a practical point of view. Working knowledge of basic machine learning algorithms is a plus. You need a good working knowledge of Python 3.</p>
<p class="mce-root">You should already know how to install packages using <kbd>pip</kbd>, how to set up your working environment to work with TensorFlow, and how to enable (if available) GPU acceleration. Moreover, a good background knowledge of programming concepts, such as imperative language versus descriptive language and object-oriented programming, is required.</p>
<p>The environment setup will be covered in <a href="f62be9d4-c8e0-4590-8299-2fdad139830f.xhtml">Chapter 3</a><span>,</span><span> </span><em>TensorFlow Graph Architecture, </em>after the first two chapters on machine learning and neural network theory.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "Mount the downloaded <kbd>WebStorm-10*.dmg</kbd> disk image file as another disk in your system."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre class="mce-root">writer = tf.summary.FileWriter("log/two_graphs/g1", g1)<br/>writer = tf.summary.FileWriter("log/two_graphs/g2", g2)<br/>writer.close()</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre># create the virtualenv in the current folder (tf2)<br/><strong>pipenv --python 3.7</strong><br/># run a new shell that uses the just created virtualenv<br/><strong>pipenv shell</strong><br/># install, in the current virtualenv, tensorflow<br/><strong>pip install tensorflow==2.0</strong><br/>#or for GPU support: pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.0</pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "The second peculiarity of the <kbd>tf.Graph</kbd> structure is its <strong>graph c</strong><strong>ollections</strong>.</span><span>"</span></p>
