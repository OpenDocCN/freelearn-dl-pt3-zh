- en: In this section, we will have an overview of IoT ecosystems, the key characteristics
    of IoT data (that is, real-time big data). We explain why analytics is necessary
    for data and why **deep learning** (**DL**) is important for analysis. We will
    also look into various techniques, their models and architectures, and their suitability
    in the IoT applications domain.
