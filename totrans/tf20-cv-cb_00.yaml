- en: The release of TensorFlow 2.x in 2019 was one of the biggest and most anticipated
    events in the deep learning and artificial intelligence arena, because it brought
    with it long-overdue improvements to this popular and relevant framework, mainly
    focused on simplicity and ease of use.

- en: The adoption of Keras as the official TensorFlow high-level API, the ability
    to switch back and forth between eager and graph-based execution (thanks to `tf.function`),
    and the ability to create complex data pipelines with `tf.data` are just a few
    of the great additions that TensorFlow 2.x brings to the table.

    how to take advantage of these advancements in the context of deep learning applied
    to computer vision. We will cover a wide gamut of applications, ranging from image
    classification to more challenging ones, such as object detection, image segmentation,
    and **Automated Machine Learning** (**AutoML**).

- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B14768_01_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor021), *Getting Started
    with TensorFlow 2.x for Computer Vision*, serves as an overview of basic deep
    learning concepts, as well as being a first look at some important TensorFlow
    2.x features, such as the Keras and `tf.data.Dataset` APIs. It also teaches you
    about common and necessary tasks such as saving and loading a model and visualizing
    a network architecture. It ends with the implementation of a simple image classifier.'

    Image Classification*, goes in-depth about the most common application of deep
    neural networks to computer vision: image classification. It explores the common
    varieties of classification, such as binary and multiclass classification, and
    then transitions to examples of multilabel classification and out-of-the-box solutions
    using transfer learning and TensorFlow Hub.'

- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B14768_03_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor099), *Harnessing
    the Power of Pre-Trained Networks with Transfer Learning*, focuses on transfer
    learning, a powerful technique to reuse networks pre-trained on massive datasets
    to increase development productivity and the performance of deep learning-powered
    computer vision applications. This chapter starts by seeing you use pre-trained
    networks as feature extractors. Then, you will learn how to combine deep learning
    with traditional machine learning algorithms through a procedure called incremental
    learning. Finally, the chapter closes with two examples of fine-tuning: the first
    using the Keras API and the second relying on TensorFlow Hub.'

    such as image restoration, inverse image search indexes, and image denoising.
    It starts by introducing the dense and convolutional variants of autoencoders
    and then explains several applications, such as inverse image search engines and
    outlier detection.'
