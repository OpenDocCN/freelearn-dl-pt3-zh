<p>So far, we have become familiar with the basic pipeline that is followed in a deep learning project. We have completed two basic end-to-end projects in previous chapters using the Keras and TensorFlow.js libraries. We have become familiar with Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and Keras, and we have also seen how deep learning models can be developed using JavaScript. We have also used the Flask framework to create an API out of a deep learning model. In <a href="e9f25c1c-0665-4c87-9c74-15824b2e6d41.xhtml">chapter 4</a>, <em>Getting Started with TensorFlow.js</em>, we used third-party <strong>Application Programming Interfaces</strong> (<strong>APIs</strong>) to create a web application.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we are going to study the whole concept of APIs in detail. Starting with a more informal definition of APIs, we are going to take a look at all APIs that are relevant to deep learning. We will first look at some of the most <span>widely known deep learning APIs, and then we will look at some lesser-known deep learning APIs. We will also learn how to choose a deep learning API provider.</span></p>
<p>In this chapter, we will be covering the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">What is an API?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">How an API is different from a library?</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Some widely known deep learning APIs</li>

                    <h1 class="header-title">What is an API?</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Let's first consider a problem scenario.</p>
<p>Imagine that you are working on a web application that needs an image recognition module to be integrated into it. But you are not into computer vision and deep learning. You have a very strict deadline to meet for the project. You cannot afford to commit to studying deep learning and then complete the project's image recognition module. What should you do now? <span>Will your project be completed by the specified deadline</span>?</p>
<p>It definitely won't! However, with the power of APIs, you will be able to easily integrate the image recognition module into your web application. Let's now discuss the concept of APIs in a bit more detail.</p>
<p>An API is a set of functions (although technically an API can consist of just one function) that can be integrated into an application to perform certain tasks. Often, as developers, there are specific utilities from our favorite websites that we wish to integrate into our own applications. For example, Twitter provides an API for retrieving tweets that match a certain keyword. We can use this API to collect data, analyze it, and eventually come up with interesting insights about data.</p>
<p>Companies such as Facebook, Google, Stack Overflow, and LinkedIn provide APIs for certain tasks, and it is really worth checking them out as a developer. APIs are virtually analogous to websites. When we click on something in a website, we are redirected to another page/section. In most cases, we get a web page as the output. But APIs generally do not produce a good-looking web page as their output. APIs are meant to be used from within the code, and the output of an API is generally in some popular data interchange format, such as JSON or XML. The output is then processed accordingly with respect to the application for which the API is used. An API lets you do the tasks you want to do by providing a suite of utilities or an ecosystem without you having to worry about the details.</p>
<p>You can test an API nowadays without having to write one bit of code. For example, you can use an API client such as Postman and test an open API that you really like, and no code is required to be written in order to do that.</p>
<p>What is even more magical about APIs is that you can write code, for example, in Java and use an API developed in Python. This is particularly useful when you are working in a team where people are very particular about the different programming languages they use. One of your teammates might be very comfortable working with Java while another teammate may be a Python expert. So, the whole concept of APIs really comes in handy in these situations.</p>
<p>We are going to discuss some of the deep learning APIs that are provided by Google AI, Facebook AI Research, and others shortly. We will see how these APIs can be used to develop intelligent web applications in the upcoming chapters.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">The importance of using APIs</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Besides saving you a lot of effort in creating and deploying your own deep learning model when you need a quick production or a minimal working product demo, APIs can provide several benefits, such as these:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A standard, stable model</strong>:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">APIs for deep learning are often created by an entire group of developers working together on industry-standard technology and research tools that may not be available to all developers. Also, the models deployed through commercial APIs are often very stable to use and provide state-of-the-art features, including scalability, customization, and accuracy. So, if you're facing accuracy issues, which is a common situation in the production of deep learning models, choosing an API is a good choice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><strong>High-performance models</strong>:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Commercial deep learning APIs often run on very powerful servers and are optimized to a great degree, such that they can perform their tasks very quickly. Therefore, such APIs are very handy if you wish to speed up the learning of your deep learning ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><strong>A common platform for developers</strong>:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">While it is very simple to start coding anything from scratch, it becomes very tough when the person who coded it in the first place leaves without producing proper documentation and a new person has to pick up where they left off. Commercial APIs define a set standard of operations, and applications built with such APIs integrated into them are easy to maintain because API providers also always include extensive documentation, meaning developers can learn about the APIs beforehand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Regular and seamless updates</strong>:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">It is often expensive for a nascent-stage company to afford development time to improve deep learning models once they have got a first version running, especially if their entire business model isn't particularly centered on artificial intelligence. Any such use case would benefit greatly from API usage because APIs are maintained by people who push regular updates and new features.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering all this, then, using an API provides the latest technology, high performance, and ever-evolving models that can be plugged into an application once and then be used for years without ever having to think about the APIs again.</p>
<p>Now, you may ask what the difference is between an API and a library. Let's find out in the next section.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">How is an API different from a library?</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Nowadays, the terms <em>library</em> and <em>API</em> are used interchangeably. There are many similarities between the two, but they are different in many aspects. Much like an API, a library also provides a collection of functions and classes that can be used as per your needs. The following are some pointers that will help you to distinguish between a library and an API:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Libraries are generally specific to programming languages. For example, you cannot use the SciPy Python library if you are using a PHP programming environment. However, you can develop an API that uses SciPy and then consume the API using your PHP code.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Developers do not have direct access to an API. APIs are consumed in different ways to how libraries are. Many APIs enforce some kind of authentication before a developer can actually use them. We do not see this very often when it comes to using a library. You can easily override and overload a library function or class and use it as you will.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Libraries and APIs can be used in conjunction with each other. Many libraries use different APIs internally and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
<p>These should give you some sense of the basic differences between a library and an API. However, if you are still finding it difficult to draw the line, don't worry about it: we will be looking at lots of examples, and by the time you are done with them, you will definitely be in a position to differentiate between APIs and libraries.</p>
<p>We will now introduce some of the APIs that are widely used for developing deep learning-enabled applications, some very widely known and some not that popular.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Some widely known deep learning APIs</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In this section, we are going to take a look at some of the most widely used APIs, which are deployed for a variety of deep learning tasks, such as image recognition, sentiment detection from an image, sentiment classification, speech-to-text conversion, and so on. <span><span>To limit our discussion in</span></span> this section, we will divide deep learning tasks into two broad groups:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Computer vision and image processing</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Natural language processing</li>
</ul>
<p>We will then list some of the common tasks related to each of these groups and discuss the APIs that can be used to accomplish those tasks.</p>
<p>Let's now quickly list some common deep learning tasks and assign them to their categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Computer vision and image processing</strong>:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Image search</strong>: Just like Google Search, image search engines allow us to search for images similar to a particular image.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Image detection</strong>: This is detecting what an image is about. It is also known as label detection.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Object localization</strong>: Given an image containing a set of different objects, this involves detecting a particular object in the image.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Content moderation</strong>: Given an image, this involves the detection of inappropriate content.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Image attributing</strong>: Given an image, this involves the extraction of different traits of the image.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Natural language processing</strong>:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Parts-of-speech tagging</strong>: Given a piece of text, <span>this involves the </span>extraction of the parts of speech that the text contains.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Topic summarization</strong>: Given a piece of text, <span>this involves </span>determining the topic that the text is about.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Sentiment classification</strong>: Given some text, <span>this involves </span>predicting the sentiment that the text is conveying.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Named entity recognition</strong>: T<span>his involves the a</span>utomatic recognition of different entities present in a given sentence.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Speech-to-text conversion</strong>: This involves the extraction of the text contained in a piece of speech<span>.  </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the tasks listed here are extremely useful in our day-to-day lives and it is exciting to know that we can make applications that are able to do these tasks for us with the APIs that we are going to discuss now.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">There are other deep learning APIs for making casual inferences at scale, but for the time being, we can ignore them and focus on the two areas that are most impacted by deep learning.</div>

<p>Now, among this ocean (well, almost) of APIs, how do you choose a particular provider for a specific task? It can be tricky and demands a discussion. In this section, we are going to discuss some of the strategies that can effectively help us to make these decisions.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Choosing a deep learning API provider</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>With the long list of API providers for deep learning that could be compiled, it can be a daunting task to decide which API you require. However, there are some simple rules that you can follow to come up with the most suitable API for your needs, and we'll be discussing a few of them in detail here:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Platforms</strong>:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">As simple as it sounds, this is probably the foremost factor that comes into play when you are choosing your API provider. Most of the time, if you are developing a product that runs on Google technologies, for instance, you might want to use the deep learning APIs that Google provides, simply because they would integrate seamlessly with the application development interface that you are working with.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">More often than not, a development environment also offers templated solutions for using its deep learning APIs that are very simple to set up. Sometimes, the provider may also offer extra incentives for using their APIs to develop new products.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Performance</strong>:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">With access to multiple providers' APIs to perform a single task, you have the option of comparing their performance and then choosing. In such cases, it's up to you as to the metric to use when comparing and judging different APIs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Cost</strong>:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Different providers use different methods of costing, and this can play a huge role in deciding which provider you use. A certain provider may have a comfortable limit on the number of free API calls for experimentation and so might be a lucrative option for you. Often, experimenting developers and students choose to go with the provider that has the best offering in terms of cost.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides these three factors, there could be some other undeniable factors, such as a company requiring the usage of a certain API or your own inclination toward a certain API provider. However, unless on a large scale, it mostly matters very little which provider is used, since they all provide similar performance for small- to medium-scale usage.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we took a detailed look at the term API. In <em><a href="a33bccdc-8664-4ae7-be82-b066e5b64850.xhtml" target="_blank"/></em><a href="a33bccdc-8664-4ae7-be82-b066e5b64850.xhtml"/><a href="a33bccdc-8664-4ae7-be82-b066e5b64850.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a><a href="a33bccdc-8664-4ae7-be82-b066e5b64850.xhtml" target="_blank"/>, <em>Creating Your First Deep Learning Web Application</em>, we saw how an API can be written in Python using Flask and we saw how to use that API in a web application. We now know how an API is different from a language library and how important it is to make use of APIs. We became familiar with a variety of deep learning APIs that are offered by some top-notch organizations. </p>
<p>As we progress through the upcoming chapters, we will see how to use these APIs to build powerful and intelligent web applications. We will start with the deep learning APIs provided by Google Cloud Platform in the next chapter. </p>
