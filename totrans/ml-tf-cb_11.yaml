    a situation where a limited set of resources must be allocated between competing
    choices in such a manner that some form of long-term objective is maximized. The
    name originated from the analogy that was used to formulate the first version
    of the model. Imagine we have a gambler facing a row of slot machines who has
    to decide which ones to play, how many times, and in what order. In RL, we formulate
    it as an agent that wants to balance exploration (acquisition of new knowledge)
    and exploitation (optimizing decisions based on experience already acquired).
    The objective of this balancing is the maximization of a total reward over a period
    of time.

    reward over time.'

- en: As the preceding graph demonstrates, after an initial period of learning (indicating
    a spike in regret around iteration 30), the agent keeps getting better at serving
    the desired content. There is a lot of variation going on, which shows that even
    in a simplified setting â two users â efficient personalization remains a challenge.
    Possible avenues of improvement could involve longer training or adapting a DQN
    agent so that more sophisticated logic can be employed for prediction.
