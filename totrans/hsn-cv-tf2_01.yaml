- en: This section covers the fundamentals of computer vision and deep learning, with
    the help of concrete TensorFlow examples. Starting with a presentation of these
    technical domains, the first chapter will then walk you through the inner workings
    of neural networks. This section continues with an introduction to the instrumental
    features of TensorFlow 2 and Keras, and their key concepts and ecosystems. It
    ends with a description of machine learning techniques adopted by computer vision
    experts.
