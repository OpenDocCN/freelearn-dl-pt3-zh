<p>The IoT has diverse application domains, including health and medical care. Use of IoT in healthcare is growing at a dangerously fast pace, and market research shows that the global IoT healthcare market could reach US $534.3 billion by 2025. Most of these applications, including remote and real-time patient monitoring, will generate heterogeneous, streaming, and/or big data. However, analyzing and extracting useful information from this data is a challenging task for medical and healthcare professionals. In this context, <strong>machine learning</strong> (<strong>ML</strong>) and <strong>deep learning</strong> (<strong>DL</strong>) models can address the challenge by automated analysis, classification of various data, and detection of anomalies within data. The healthcare industry is extensively using ML and DL for various applications. Hence, the use of ML/DL models in IoT healthcare applications is a necessity for the true realization of healthcare IoT.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we present DL-based IoT solutions for healthcare in general. In the first part of the chapter, we will present an overview of the various applications of IoT in healthcare. Then, we will briefly discuss two use cases where healthcare services can be improved and/or automatized through DL-supported IoT solutions. In the second part of the chapter, we will present hands-on experience of the DL-based healthcare incident and/or diseases detection part of the two use cases. In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>IoT and healthcare applications</li>
<li>Use case one: remote chronic disease management</li>
<li>Implementation of r<span>emote chronic disease management</span></li>
<li>Use case two: IoT for acne detection and care</li>
<li>Implementation of a<span>cne detection and care</span></li>
<li>DL for IoT in healthcare</li>

<p>Globally, health and medical care services are facing tremendous challenges owing to, for example, soaring costs, an ageing population, an increase in the prevalence of chronic and/or multiple conditions, and a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals. In addition, traditional care services relying on average and/or qualitative data and a one-size-fits-all prescribing approach do not work well. In this context, the use of IoT in healthcare services addresses many of these challenges by offering the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seamless integration with various existing technologies</li>
<li>Support of big data processing and analysis</li>
<li>Personalized services</li>
<li>Remote and real-time monitoring-based connected healthcare services</li>
<li>Quantitative data, which offer more effective services <span>than qualitative data</span></li>
<li>Interactive and real-time interaction between healthcare professionals and patients</li>
<li>Ubiquitous access to services</li>
<li>Efficient management of healthcare resources</li>
</ul>
<p>All these features of the IoT-based solutions will disrupt the healthcare industry by offering various services. These services can be viewed and served in two different environments:</p>
<ul>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><span>Hospital and clinics</span></li>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><span>Non-clinical patient environments</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagram highlights a few main applications of these two <span>environments</span> and presents a list of potential services in each of the <span>environments</span>:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928 image-border" src="assets/67da9769-c4a9-4793-b631-f0db4541f3f5.png" style="width:109.83em;height:46.00em;"/></p>
<p>The following are the key subdomains of IoT healthcare:</p>
<ul>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><strong>Smart hospitals</strong>: Globally, in both developed and developing countries, hospitals are overcrowded with patients. Also, they have a shortage of resources—including skilled professionals—and equipment. The situation is really bad in rural areas of <span>most countries</span>, where people have limited or no access to healthcare facilities. In this context, IoT-based remote services, such as remote monitoring and telemedicine, can offer access to many basic healthcare services. Also, remote monitoring of elderly patients and those with chronic diseases can greatly reduce healthcare-related costs, and improve quality of life for both patients and healthcare professionals. Smart and connected ambulances can offer on-fleet prompt and emergency services, and reduce emergency services-related incidents. In an operating room, connected doctors (locally and externally), staff, and medical devices can offer a better and smoother operating environment. Also, inventory management in hospitals can be greatly improved through IoT applications.</li>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><strong>Clinics</strong>: Many people go to a <strong>general practitioner</strong> <strong>(</strong><strong>GP)</strong> practice or clinic for primary care services. These service providers can also benefit from using IoT applications. For example, a GP can view and analyze virtually the patient's pathology report, which saves time for both parties. Importantly, patients will get more time for care-related discussions than information gathering. Clinics can verify insurance coverage for patients in real time. Appointment management in clinics and GP practices is a global challenge. In England, approximately 15 million appointments per year are missed, which costs <span>the <strong>National Health Service</strong> (<strong>NHS</strong>)</span> millions of pounds. This situation can be improved by IoT-based applications.</li>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><strong>Non-clinical patient environments</strong>: Two potential application areas of IoT could be connected—the patient and the smart home. Here, the smart home would offer <span>healthcare services to patients </span>anytime and anywhere. Remote monitoring of a prescribed intervention, such as physiotherapy, can be done through a connected patient application. Also, patients can get personalized services, such as reminders to take medication. O<span>ffering m</span>onitoring and healthcare services to elderly people is a great challenge worldwide. Smart home solutions can improve existing services and offer new services for these highly vulnerable people through fall detection, medication reminders, telemedicine, and general assisted living.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is clear from the preceding discussion that IoT has huge potential in healthcare domains. In the following section, we will briefly discuss two use cases of IoT in healthcare.</p>

<p>Chronic diseases—including cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and diabetes—cause over 40 million deaths per year globally. This problem has different dimensions in developing countries and developed countries. In developing countries, people with chronic diseases have limited or no access to many basic health services, including early or on-time detection facilities, which leads to many deaths. On the other hand, in developed countries, medical research has led to a significant increase in life expectancy. This has been achieved by means of, for example, early detection and monitoring of disease. However, in developed countries, including the UK, for every 2 years of increased life <span>expectancy</span>, we gain just 1 year of quality life. Consequently, the proportion of our lives spent with chronic diseases and disability is rising. The cost of managing patients with multiple chronic diseases is trillions of dollars/pounds. Fortunately, IoT-based remote monitoring of patients with chronic diseases can address most of these issues and offer cost-effective services.</p>

<p>We are considering an IoT-based remote patient monitoring application for use case one. The following diagram briefly presents how the IoT-based, remote patient monitoring and management system will work:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/39cdf21e-54aa-48f0-b6c3-a6da036d7a59.png"/></p>
<p>As shown, the IoT-based, remote patient monitoring system consists of three main elements, namely, smart home, care providers, and Health Cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smart home</strong>: This is the heart of the solution, and includes the patient and various devices for the IoT solutions. The smart home consists of the following key components:
<ul>
<li><strong>Patient</strong>: A patient will be attached to multiple sensors, including an <strong><span>electrocardiogram</span> (ECG)</strong>, blood pressure sensor, accelerometer, and gyroscope. These sensors will collect physiological and activity-related data and send them to the care providers for necessary and real-time feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Ambient sensing</strong>: Body sensors and wearable devices are not sufficient to cover all of the activities of the patient. Also, patients do not feel comfortable with too many sensors on their body for many reasons, including the need for seamless movement. The smart home will be installed with various ambient sensors, including light, vibration, motion, pressure, and door sensors. These sensors will provide contextual information about the patient.</li>
<li><strong>Edge computing platform</strong>: We have various options for this component, for example, a smartphone/tablet, edge gateway, or a Raspberry Pi 3. For this use case, we are considering a Raspberry Pi 3. All the sensors mentioned earlier can be connected to the Raspberry Pi 3. Most will sense the environment and/or patient's activity continuously, and others will be event-driven (for example, the door sensor will be activated if someone opens or knocks on the door). These sensors will send data to the <span>Raspberry Pi 3</span> for further processing, including detecting events such as high blood pressure or body temperature, or a fall. Finally, this processed data will be sent to the care providers through the home router, and Health Cloud. Importantly, the <span>Raspberry Pi 3</span> will be installed with various pretrained DL/ML models, including an ECG measurement classifier for detection of any heart-related anomalies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Health Cloud for model learning and data analysis:</strong> The Health Cloud is a cloud computing platform, mainly designed for healthcare-related services, and is mainly responsible for the following:
<ul>
<li>DL model training</li>
<li>Data analysis</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign" style="padding-left: 60px">The model training component will train the necessary DL models for categorizing or classifying a variety of physiological signals from the patient and contextual data to make informed decisions. The Health Cloud will receive various data from the <span>Raspberry Pi 3</span>, and some of them may conflict with each other. In this context, a data analysis tools will analyze and present the data to the healthcare professionals for decision making.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Care providers</strong>: Care providers can be hospitals or clinics that provide care services. As many patients have multiple chronic diseases, most need to be directly or indirectly connected with more than one specialized doctor. Once the doctor receives information about the patient and their environment, they will make a decision with the support of other data, including historical data from an <strong>electronic health record (EHR)</strong>. Once the decision has been made, it will be sent back to the patient and, if necessary, a decision will be actuated through the appropriate devices (such as an insulin pump) connected to the patient.</li>
</ul>
<p>ECG-based health checking of the heart is an essential element of the above use case. In the second part of the chapter, we will describe implementation of the DL-based ECG measurement classification of the preceding use case.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Acne is one of the world's most common skin conditions. Most people, at some point in their lifetime, are affected by acne. Generally, acne develops on the face and appears as spots (as shown in the following diagram) and oily skin. Sometimes, the skin can become hot or painful to the touch. Acne can manifest as whiteheads, blackheads, pustules, papules, cysts, and nodules. The first three are also known as pimples. Different types of acne need different treatments and care; therefore, detection and automated classification of acne could be useful. Acne can be confused with one of three similar conditions—rosacea, eczema, or allergic reaction—because patients often self-diagnose and treat. Incorrect diagnosis and treatment can make the condition worse. The following diagram shows two examples of what acne can look like:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929 image-border" src="assets/462bc10c-3fce-4d56-bd9d-f1b8da31dd06.png" style="width:34.92em;height:12.08em;"/></p>
<p>Generally, acne is not only a physical health issue, but also a mental health issue for many affected people. According to research, acne is significantly linked with depression. In a study published in the <em>British Journal of Dermatology</em>, researchers analyzing the records of patients with acne between 1986 and 2012 in the UK made a strong claim about the mental health issues these patients. They concluded that patients with acne have a 63% higher risk of developing depression compared with patients who did not have acne.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will present an innovative solution using IoT and DL modes to address the acne d<span>etection/diagnosis </span>problem.</p>

<p>Most people with acne and related skin conditions use a mirror to detect acne and monitor the progress of treatment. Therefore, the innovative idea is to create a smart and connected mirror to help the user detect and identify skin (mainly facial) anomalies, including acne.</p>
<p>The following diagram presents an IoT infrastructure for the implementation of automated acne detection, classification, and care services:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/ac01b78e-eb75-47d6-b1e2-c9ceb7318ff4.png"/></p>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">As shown in the diagram, the IoT-based automated acne detection, classification, and care system consists of three main elements—a smart mirror, care providers, and the Health Cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smart mirror</strong>: This is the heart of the solution, and includes the following three components:
<ul>
<li><strong>Camera</strong>: The mirror features a high-resolution camera embedded in such a way that it will be able to capture facial images. There will be a button in the mirror that will activate the detection process, as a patient might not always be interested or in need of the service. The mirror will also have a small display to present the results and/or suggested treatment for the acne from care providers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li><strong>Edge computing platform</strong>: We have various options for this component, including a smartphone/tablet, edge gateway, or a Raspberry Pi 3. For this use case, we are considering a Raspberry Pi 3 that will be connected to the camera. Once it receives the images, it will detect any skin-related issue, including acne, with the support of a preinstalled DL model. Finally, the <span>Raspberry Pi 3</span> will send the detection results, along with the images, to a care provider to obtain treatment suggestions. Also, a model can be incorporated in the <span>Raspberry Pi 3</span> (not within the scope of this book) that will analyze facial images for potential depression detection and corresponding support from a psychiatrist.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Health Cloud for model learning and data</strong>: The Health Cloud is a cloud computing platform mainly designed for healthcare-related services. This cloud platform will be used to train the DL model for the image-based detection and classification of acne and other skin conditions. The Health Cloud is also responsible for updating any preinstalled model in the <span>Raspberry Pi 3</span> or IoT devices.</li>
<li><strong>Care providers</strong>: Care providers can be hospitals and clinics that provide care services. As acne might cause depression, we are considering two potential doctors—a dermatologist for skin-related issues and a psychiatrist for depression-related issues. Once the doctors receive the detected information and images, they will make a decision with the support of other data, including historical images of the patient. Finally, the suggested treatment or feedback will be sent back to the patient.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following sections, we will describe implementation of the DL-based solutions required for the aforementioned use cases. All the necessary codes are available in the chapter's code folder.</p>

<p>DL models are evolving as the most powerful and effective computing resources for every industry. They are contributing significantly to the industries' value by improving user experience and enabling more informed decision making. Healthcare is one of the key application domains of DL, and DL has been further progressed by the increasing availability of heterogeneous healthcare data.</p>
<p>Unlike many other industries, the health and medical industries are obtaining highly value-added applications in many areas, including research, innovation, and real-world medical environments. Many of these applications are patient-facing (such as early detection and prediction of cancer, and personalized medicine) and others are for improving the user experience in various aspects of healthcare IT. The following diagram highlights some of the application areas of DL in healthcare:</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Healthcare applications generate big data, and they come from heterogeneous sources in heterogeneous formats. A large number of these, including screening and diagnostic data from <strong>magnetic resonance imaging</strong> <strong>(MRI)</strong>, X-ray, and ultrasound are in image format. Human physiological signals, such as those detected by <strong>electromyography</strong> (<strong>EMG</strong>), <strong>electroencephalography</strong> (<strong>EEG</strong>), ECG, and <strong>electrooculography</strong> <strong>(EOG)</strong>, are time series data. EHRs include structured (such as diagnosis, prescriptions, and laboratory tests) as well as unstructured (such as free-text clinical notes) clinical data. Also, high-throughput biology, such as genomics, produces high-dimensional data regarding <span>human</span> <span>i</span>nternal structures. All of this different healthcare data requires the support of ML—especially DL—to extract valuable information and gain insights into any potential issues.</p>
<p>A number of DL models have been used for the analysis of these heterogeneous healthcare data. CNN and LSTMs (RNNs) are the most widely used DL models, as their features work well with most healthcare data types. For example, CNN models are best for image processing and are used for various medical images. By contrast, LSTMs/RNNs are best for most physiological signals, as they have a memory feature to handle the temporal properties of the signals. ECG measurements are one of the key physiological signals in screening for cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the remote patient-monitoring system includes a DL-based ECG signal analyzer for detecting various heart conditions, such as <strong>atrial fibrillation</strong> (<strong>AF</strong>).</p>
<p>Considering the temporal aspect of the ECG signal, we will consider an LSTM for the implementation of the remote patient monitoring system. In addition, we will test a CNN for the ECG signal as a comparison. The IoT-based acne detection and care system will rely on images. Therefore, we will implement this using a CNN architecture. Both of these DL models have been briefly presented in chapters; please refer to those for an overview.</p>

<p>Data collection for health and medical care applications is a challenging task for many reasons, including privacy and ethical issues. In this context, we have decided to use two different open source datasets for the two use cases.</p>

<p>The ECG dataset for use case one has been collected from 2017 PhysioNet/computing in cardiology challenge. This dataset consists of 8,528 ECG measurements. These measurements were recorded through an AliveCor hand-held device (as shown in the following screenshot), and, interestingly, this is an example healthcare IoT application:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930 image-border" src="assets/b4924850-4a0a-41b9-91e9-a7c69d172df3.jpg" style="width:32.33em;height:29.42em;"/></p>
<p>The sampling rate of the ECG measurements was 300 Hz, and noise was removed by band-pass filtered by the AliveCor device. Each recorded measurement is compliant with MATLAB V4 WFDB format, and consists of two files:</p>
<ul>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">A file with a <kbd>.mat</kbd> extension that presents the main ECG signal information</li>
<li class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">A corresponding header file with a <kbd>.hea</kbd> extension that contains the waveform-related information of the measurement</li>
</ul>
<p>The dataset consists of four different classes of signals: normal rhythm, AF, other rhythm, or too noisy to classify. The following diagram presents a visualization of these different classes of the ECG signals:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/74bcce0f-4072-4a35-98ff-2b1cc7824def.png" style="width:28.33em;height:15.50em;"/></p>
<p>AF is characterized by rapid and irregular beating of the atria and indicates that the heart rhythm is not normal. Other abnormal heart rhythms are considered as the other rhythm class. Finally, any measurements that do not reflect one of the three classes, as they are too noisy to be classified, are defined as a noisy measurement. The DL model-based classifier needs to extract these features in the measurements to classify the signals recorded from the patient, and the corresponding heart-related issues. For a better understanding and real-life implementation, further studies on ECG signals are necessary, which is not within the scope of this book. The following graph presents normal versus AF heart signal measurements:</p>

<p>For the acne detection and care system use case, we are relying on an image dataset. We have <span><span>gathered</span></span> images from the <em>Dermnet Skin Disease Atlas</em>, which is an open-source database on various skin diseases. The database contains 23 datasets, each on a different skin disease, and each of the categories (including acne and rosacea) has subcategories. The datasets are not easily downloaded as there are too many pages. We have written an image, or image scraper, using Python's Beautiful Soup module, and we have made the scraper generic so that readers can test their LSTM/CNN models on the different skin diseases. The scraper <kbd>image_scraper.py</kbd> is available in the chapter's code subfolder, <kbd>use-case-2</kbd>. To scrap all 23 datasets, run the following command:</p>

<p>We have used the acne and rosacea images dataset. The following screenshot presents a folder view of the dataset, including the number of images in the class. Unfortunately, as we can see, only four of the folders or classes have 100 or more images:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/cf6844f3-d4fb-4ce3-9e45-d4531507e121.png"/></p>
<p>As we are using MobileNet v1 architecture, any class with lower than 100 images might show an error. In fact, we have tested this and found the data size-related error. In this context, we have chosen a reduced dataset, which consists of only four classes of data that have more than 100 images.</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows the reduced acne dataset following exploration:</p>

<p>Data preprocessing is an essential step for a DL pipeline. The ECG dataset is not ready to be used for model training and validation. The preprocessor for the ECG signals is included in the model training and validation codes, <kbd>LSTM_ECG.py</kbd> and <kbd>CNN1D_ECG.py</kbd>, respectively. They will run the models after preprocessing <kbd>.mat</kbd> input data. However, the acne image dataset is ready to be used for training and validation.</p>

<p>As we mentioned earlier, we are using LSTM and CNN, particularly 1D CNN, for use case one. For use case two, we are using MobileNet v1. All of these DL implementations support transfer learning that does not require training from scratch to use them in IoT devices.</p>

<p>We used an LSTM five-layered architecture for the ECG data classification, as shown in the following diagram:</p>

<p>We can train and test the model by running the <kbd>LSTM_ECG.py</kbd> file available in the chapter's code folder named <kbd>use-case-1</kbd> subfolder:</p>
<pre><strong>python LSTM_ECG.py</strong></pre>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>For the ECG data in the remote patient-management system, we also tested and validated a CNN model. The following <span>diagram</span> presents the CNN architecture we used for the ECG dataset. As we can see, the CNN architecture consists of four convolutional layers:</p>

<p>We have evaluated three different aspects of the models:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify">Learning/(re)training time</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Storage requirement</li>
<li style="text-align: justify">Performance (accuracy)</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of training time, in a desktop (Intel Xenon CPU E5-1650 v3 @3.5 GHz and 32 GB RAM) with GPU support, LSTM and CNN 1D on the ECG data took more than one hour, and MobileNet v1 on the acne dataset took less than 1 hour.</p>
<p>The storage requirement of a model is an essential consideration in resource-constrained IoT devices. The following screenshot presents the storage requirements for the three models we tested for the two use cases:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/6c66eabf-5f6a-494a-96cc-cea9d8fc6127.png"/></p>
<p>As shown, a saved model of LSTM took 234 MB of storage, CNN 1D took 8.5 MB, and MobileNet v1 (CNN) took 16.3 MB. In terms of storage requirements, all of the models, except the current version of LSTM, are fine to be deployed in many resource-constrained IoT devices, including Raspberry Pi 3 or smartphones.</p>
<p>Finally, we have evaluated the performance of the models. In both of the use cases, dataset-wide evaluation or testing has been executed during the training phase in the desktop PC platform/server side, but we can also test them in the Raspberry Pi 3 or any IoT edge computing devices as the models are transferable.</p>

<p>The following screenshot shows the training and validation result of the LSTM used on the ECG dataset. As seen in the screenshot, the test accuracy is consistently very close to 1.0 or 100%. However, validation accuracy is not great, and is in the range of 50% for the two different runs of the model (100 and 500 epochs). The following <span>screenshot</span> shows how the LSTM model is progressing during the training stage:</p>

<p><span>The matrix clearly highlights the fact that the LSTM model is performing poorly on the ECG data. In particular, it is failing to identify most AF measurements (abnormal heart rhythm). </span></p>

Models with this level of accuracy should be able to classify the correct heart rhythm of the patient in most cases <span>and report</span> <span>accordingly</span>. <span>The following screenshot shows how the CNN 1D model is progressing during the training stage and its final training and validation accuracy:</span></p>

<p>The <span>CCN 1D model's performance can be improved; it can even be made very close to 100% by making the model's network denser. However, this will make the model complex, and the trained model will need more memory, making it unsuitable for resource-constrained IoT devices.</span></p>

<p>The healthcare industry is adopting ML and DL for various applications. IoT healthcare applications need to adopt ML and DL techniques for the true realization of healthcare IoT. In this chapter, we have tried to show how DL-based IoT solutions can be useful and how they can be implemented in healthcare applications. In the first part of this chapter, we presented an overview of the various applications of IoT in healthcare. Then, we briefly discussed two use cases where healthcare services can be improved and/or automated through DL-supported IoT solutions. In the second part of the chapter, we presented a hands-on experience of the DL-based healthcare incident and/or skin diseases, detection part of the two use cases.</p>
<p>The use of DL in IoT applications is emerging. However, there are challenges associated with DL techniques and IoT that need to be addressed soon in order to get the best results from the integration of these two exciting technologies. In the next and final chapter, we will identify and discuss these challenges. In addition, we will provide a few future directions to mitigate some of the issues.</p>
