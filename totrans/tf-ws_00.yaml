- en: If you want to learn to build deep learning models in TensorFlow to solve real-world
    problems, then this is the book for you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Beginning with an introduction to TensorFlow, this book gives you a tour of
    the basic mathematical operations of tensors, as well as various methods of data-preparation
    for modeling and time-saving model-development using TensorFlow resources. You
    will build regression and classification models, use regularization to prevent
    models from overfitting training data, and create convolutional neural networks
    to solve classification tasks on image datasets. Finally, you'll learn to implement
    pre-trained, recurrent, and generative models and create your own custom TensorFlow
    components to use within your models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By the end of this book, you'll have the practical skills to build, train, and
    evaluate deep learning models using the TensorFlow framework.
