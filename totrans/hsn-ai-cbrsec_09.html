<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">In a context such as the current one, characterized by a growing disintermediation of traditional services offered to users in digital forms (such as e-commerce, home banking, and so on), it is important to correctly identify and prevent possible threats that target use's digital identity, such as the risk of identity theft. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">Moreover, with the rapid spread of the </span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Internet of Things</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1"> (</span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">IoT</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">), the possibility of unauthorized access obtained by exploiting counterfeit credentials (or by stealing them from legitimate owners) is more probable than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">It is the dimension of cyberspace with its increased attack surface, which is determined by the exponential number of connections that can be established between humans and machines, and between machines and machines, that makes the risk of information leakage much more likely.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">Protecting user accounts is not only a question of data integrity but also a reputational risk for any corporate from which legal responsibilities toward third parties may also arise. </span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">Just think of all the issues concerning the spread of fake accounts, which are created on purpose to capture confidential and sensitive information from users. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">There's also the issue of troll accounts, which can contribute to confusing and conditioning legitimate users who are not aware of the fictitious nature of these counterparts.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">With the diffusion of automated services, which are increasingly managed by algorithms, it also becomes essential, from a legal point of view, to guarantee the correctness and legitimacy of sensitive information collected through automated procedures; a corporate can be called upon to respond in accordance with the principle of accountability, which was established by the EU's </span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">General Data Privacy Regulation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1"> (</span><span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">GDPR</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">)</span></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">Due to this, it is necessary to put in place all the organizational measures necessary to guarantee the security of user accounts, which is done by monitoring suspicious activities such as attempts to compromise passwords.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">One of the weaknesses of protecting user accounts is the poor protection of passwords.</span></p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">Passwords have always been the main tool to guarantee the protection of user accounts over time; however, they have shown their limits.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">As the number of online services (and different access platforms that you can use to access these services) grows, the number of passwords that the user must memorize has grown accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">Since the robustness in the choice of alphanumeric codes constituting reliable passwords is opposed to their ease of management, users often use the same password for multiple accounts and services.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">This contributes to the growth of the attack surface, raising the risk of being compromised. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">If an attacker succeeds in stealing a user's credentials (for example, their personal email account), it is very likely that they can also violate other credentials and therefore, succeed in stealing the victim's digital identity.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">The risk of identity theft is, in fact, one of the major threats that can affect a user. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">Once the victim's identity has been violated, the attacker can undertake a series of illegal activities, such as money laundering through the creation of bank accounts on behalf of the victim, disguised behind the credentials of the user who is often unaware of the illicit activities that take place.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">It is no coincidence that, over time, security measures have been adopted that integrate password authentication and account authorization procedures. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">These deploy monitoring tasks aimed at increasing contextual awareness, that is, analyzing and circumscribing activities related to the use of access credentials within a context considered normal (or otherwise suspect) for the individual user.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">The protection of a user's account is not limited to the simple verification of the correctness of the entered password and the correspondence of the password to the user account, but also the various account activities that are recorded, such as simultaneous access from IP addresses belonging to different geographical areas, or the use of different devices, such as PCs, and smartphones, browsers, and operating systems that are unusual or have never been used before.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">The objective of this monitoring is obviously to detect possible credential theft by the attackers, who attempt to access user accounts by exploiting previously violated passwords.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">To achieve this level of contextual security awareness, it is necessary to integrate monitoring activities that occur on user accounts with anomaly detection procedures that make use of automated learning algorithms, thus learning to discriminate between different suspicious activities based on the habits and behavior of the users themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">It is also possible to replace the same passwords with authentication procedures that make use of a user's biometric credentials, such as their iris, voice, fingerprints, or face.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">In this situation, it is not appropriate to limit the recognition procedure to a single biometric piece of evidence, which, although robust, is still spoofable (falsifiable by taking advantage of the limitations and vulnerabilities affecting the sensors used to verify the biometric data). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">Instead, we should integrate this with different methods of verifying user credentials.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">To ensure that the credentials really belong to the legitimate owner of the account, over time, various forms of verification have been introduced, some of which are based on the adoption of second authentication factors, such as the insertion of temporary passwords that are transmitted as OTP codes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">These are delivered via SMS messages to the user's phone number, or via the email address associated with the user's account. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.3">The reliability of such a procedures is based on secondary factors, such as the integrity of the support and channels that are  used to receive and manage these authentication factors.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">If the user's email account has been hacked or malware has been installed on a smartphone on which SMS messages are read automatically forwards the OTP codes to the attacker, the ineffectiveness of second authentication factors for security purposes is evident.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">The assumption on which the effectiveness of secondary </span><span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">authentication</span></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1"> factors is based, lies in the diversification of the supports used. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">In other words, it is suggested that the user does not keep all of their personal, sensitive information within a single support (following one of the most well-known risk management best practices that prescribe, </span><em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">not to keep all our eggs in the same basket</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">).</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">If this diversification assumption is not verified, the reliability of the authentication procedures based on the second </span><span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">authentication</span></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1"> factors also inevitably cease.</span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">From what we have said so far, it should be clear that the use of authentication procedures based on security tokens, such as passwords, SMS, OTPs, and others, should at least be integrated with automated anomaly detection procedures.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Among the anomalies related to the management of user accounts is the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">Brute force access attempts, aimed at identifying the user's password by entering different passwords within a limited period of time</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Simultaneous access from IP addresses belonging to different geographical areas</span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">The use of devices, software, and operating systems that are uncommon for the user</span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">Frequency and typing speed that's incompatible with human operators</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">Obviously, the list of events to be monitored can increase and vary depending on the specific analysis context. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">However, it is important that, once fed a historical basis of representative events, there is automated detection of anomalies.</span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">Once the representative events related to suspicious access have accumulated, it is important to understand the management strategy that is intended to be followed. </span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">The more traditional one foresees the configuration of </span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">reactive</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1"> alarm systems; that is, once possible unauthorized access is identified, the alarm system triggers an event (reaction) and the user account is automatically suspended or blocked.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">The reactive strategy, although simple to implement, presents the following important side effects and drawbacks:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root"><span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">Possibility of </span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">denial of service</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1"> (</span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">DoS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">) attacks targeting legitimate users; the attacker damages the organization's reputation by simulating unauthorized access attempts to trigger the automatic blocking of user accounts issued by the alarm system increase</span></span><span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1"> disruption both to the users and the company that provides the services.</span></span></li>
<li class="mce-root"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">A reactive alarm system is usually set with default triggers associated with the relevant events. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">The event calibration takes place globally for all users and the system does not learn to recognize individual users on the basis of their specific behaviors.</span></li>
<li class="mce-root"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">A reactive strategy reads the reality through the rear-view mirror, that is, it assumes that the future is the same as the past and, therefore, doesn't automatically adapt to rapid changes in context.</span></li>
<li class="mce-root"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">A reactive strategy is usually based on the monitoring of anomalous activity peaks, that is, conduct is considered suspicious if it exceeds certain predetermined levels that are considered normal. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">This happens in the case of attacks that are conducted in </span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">stealth</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1"> mode, which don't cause anomalous peaks of activity that exceed the alarm threshold. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.2">The attacker can remain hidden inside the system,  and can perform information gathering and abusive operations undisturbed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.3">One of the biggest large-scale user account violations hit the Yahoo! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.4">web portal. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.5">It was conducted in stealth mode and it took several years for the violations to be discovered and made known to the public.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">On the contrary, a strategy to combat user accounts being compromised must consider changes in the context and scenario that may affect both the behavior of the user and the attacker, this requires the adoption of a predictive approach to anomaly detection, which, starting from the analysis of past data, is able to bring out the latent patterns, extrapolating the users' future behaviors, and identifying possible attempts at compromise or fraud on time.</span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">The task of predictive analytics is to reveal hidden patterns, identifying latent trends within the data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">To this end, it is necessary to combine various data mining and </span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">machine learning</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1"> (</span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">ML</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">) methodologies in order to exploit sets of structured and unstructured data from the various heterogeneous information sources available to the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">This way, it is possible to translate the raw data into actionable predictive responses, applying different automated learning algorithms to the data.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">Different algorithms will obviously provide different results in terms of predictive accuracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">As we have seen in the previous chapters, classification algorithms are particularly suitable when we have to manage </span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">discrete</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1"> answers (spam or ham), while if we need </span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">continuous</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1"> outputs (that is, output values ​​characterized by greater granularity), the use of regression algorithms are our preferred choice.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">Similarly, to manage large-scale classification tasks, we can consider the use of linear </span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">support vector machines</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1"> (</span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">SVMs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">) and the use of </span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">decision trees</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1"> and </span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">random forests</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">, which usually provide the best results when we need to categorize data.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">A special mention must then be given to unsupervised learning and clustering algorithms, which are particularly indicated in the exploration of latent and unknown patterns within the data, to carry out tasks such as the anomaly detection of suspicious user behavior.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">Following a predictive approach in order to detect possible user account violations, translates into the choice of the correct features to monitor. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">These vary according to the threats that we believe may be more likely to occur.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">In the case of the prevention of attacks that are conducted through brute forcing user credentials (user ID and password), it may be sufficient to monitor the number of failed access attempts (logins) and detect their growth rate and variations over time In other cases, the </span><span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">monitored</span></span><span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1"> </span></span><span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">element could be the frequent number of password changes, failed logins, password recovery, and so on</span></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">More difficult is the detection of possible stealth-mode attacks conducted by attackers who have the correct user password already available (because they had previously compromised the email account associated with the user account, thus exploiting password recovery procedures), or detect user sessions that are being hijacked (also known as </span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">session hijacking</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1"> which consists of the abuse of a session regularly initiated by the legitimate user and exploited by the attacker to achieve fraudulent goals) without the apparent compromise of account credentials.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">In this case, it may be useful to monitor the IP addresses associated with the user logins, in order to verify that access isn't made simultaneously from geographical areas that are distant from each other, or that access does not occur too frequently within a limited period of time, using devices and software uncommon for a specific user to use.</span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">The creation of user accounts is also an activity to monitor to prevent the possible spread of fake profiles within our platforms; just think of the illegal activities that these fake profiles can put in place by confusing and deceiving legitimate users and inducing them into behaviors that can lead to fraud or the compromising of their accounts.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Events that need to be monitored can be traced back to the usual phases entailed in the creation of fake profiles, namely the request to activate new accounts and the identification of fake profiles among already existing accounts, which must be blocked or cancelled due to user misconduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">A possible indicator of the anomalous creation of new accounts (which have a high probability of being fake profiles) is constituted by the activation of numerous new accounts being carried out by the same IP address within a short period of time (in less than an hour, for example).</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">In the case of existing accounts, an anomaly indicator that can reliably indicate the presence of a fake profile can be a large number of user posts delivered within a short period of time, which makes us think that a bot aimed at spreading spam on the platform is present.</span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">The monitoring of user account activity must, therefore, take into account both newly created and existing accounts to prevent malicious activities carried out by existing accounts that are being compromised by the attacker. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">It is advisable to associate a measure of reputation (reputation scoring) estimated on the basis of the behavior held by the associated user. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.3">This reputation scoring also allows us to identify attacks conducted in stealth mode, thus preventing the risk of attacks going undetected. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.4">It does this by leveraging alarm systems calibrated to monitor anomalous and noisy peaks of activity.</span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">However logical it may seem to follow a supervised learning strategy, it is necessary to take into consideration the methodological risks involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">One of the main problems is that our algorithms will have difficulty in learning to recognize new cases of suspicious activity as they will have been conditioned by previous classification labels, which may be affected by systematic errors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">In order to proceed with the retraining of our models, to detect new forms of suspicious activity, we would be forced to insert different classification rules from the previous ones, which should be able to correctly detect the new labels associated with new samples.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">However, this does not prevent the risk of amplifying the systematic errors previously introduced in our models; if we have mistakenly included some classes of users within the blacklists (for example, all users who connect from IP addresses belonging to a specific geographical area, previously identified as the origin of the spam campaign) we will introduce false positives in our models, which will systematically feed themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">To reduce the distortive effect of these false positives, we should carry out an appropriate weighing of the samples to be submitted to our algorithms at each subsequent training phase.</span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">Another</span><span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1"> </span></span><span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">approach that could be used to classify suspicious activities on user accounts is clustering. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">By grouping user accounts into homogeneous groups, based on t</span></span><span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">he type of activity carried out (frequency of user posts, time spent on the platform, frequency of user logins, and more), it is also possible to identify suspicious activities that may concern multiple user accounts compromised by the same attacker, whose purpose could be, for example, to spread spam messages or publish unwanted posts by coordinating the activities of the various accounts.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">Clustering is, in fact, an approach that allows the detection of similarities (even hidden ones) within various user groups; once grouped into different clusters, we will need to determine which of these clusters are actually representative of suspicious activity, and, within each cluster, which accounts are involved in possible fraudulent activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">However, even in the case of clustering, it is necessary to carefully choose the type of algorithm to use: in fact, not all clustering algorithms are effective in detecting suspicious activity.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">For example, clustering algorithms, such as k-means, require the correct determination of the number of clusters (by defining, in advance, the value of the parameter k, from which the algorithm takes its name), a feature that is not very suitable for the detection of suspicious user activities in practice, because we </span><span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">are not </span></span><span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">usually able to define the correct number of clusters in which the accounts must be grouped.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">Furthermore, algorithms such as k-means do not work with features expressed in the form of categories or binary classification values.</span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">Given the limitations and the methodological problems we mentioned earlier, in recent times we have increasingly resorted to new forms of detecting of suspicious user accounts using some forms of biometric recognition. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">These have been made more usable than in the past due to the increasing diffusion of neural networks.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">The same user authentication procedures are often implemented through biometric recognition, which supplements (if not replaces) the most traditional forms of password-based authentication.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">When we talk about biometric recognition, we can consider distinctive physical elements that can be reliably and exclusively traced back to a specific human user, such as the iris, face, fingerprints, voice, and more. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">Behaviors and habits can also be identified in patterns that may be reliably associated with the individual user; among these biometric behaviors, there is keystroke typing (also known as keystroke dynamics), which, like freehand writing, can help in reliably identifying different subjects.</span></p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">One of the first concrete examples of user authentication using keystroke dynamics is represented by the Signature Track technology that was introduced by Coursera a few years ago to identify students who took part in tests as being valid for the achievement of statements of accomplishment at the end of course attendance.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">The Signature Track technology that was adopted by Coursera, is described in the paper </span><em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">MOOCs and Technology to Advance Learning and Learning Research, Offering Verified Credentials in Massive Open Online Courses</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1"> by Andrew Maas, Chris Heather, Chuong (Tom) Do, Relly Brandman, Daphne Koller, and Andrew Ng–Ubiquity Symposium (</span><a href="http://ubiquity.acm.org"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">http://ubiquity.acm.org</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">), and intends to solve the problem of how to assign </span><span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">user credentials</span></span><span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1"> </span></span><span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">to each student so their identity can be verified reliably.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">Signature Track is a process that allows the connection of the student's coursework to their real identity so, at the end of the course, students receive a verified certificate in their own name, issued by Coursera and the university that offered the course.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">The certificate has a unique verification code, which also allows third parties (such as employers) to verify the completion of the course by the real candidate.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">The distinctive features of Signature Track are not only related to authentication and identity verification procedures but also high-scale dimensions due to the growing number of students enrolled in Coursera; in fact, a Coursera course usually entails between 40,000 and 60,000 students. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">Therefore, the authentication and identity verification procedures are also characterized by high efficiency without the need for intervention by instructors or staff.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">Furthermore, unlike other web services (such as online banking or e-commerce), the management of verification and authentication of Coursera user accounts is complicated by the fact that users are tempted to give their login credentials to other parties so that they can complete the user's homework on their behalf. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">This peculiarity prompted Coursera to adopt two distinct biometric and photographic authentication methods based on facial recognition and typing patterns associated with individual students. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.3">During the enrollment phase, Coursera requires the student to provide a photo via a webcam, along with a copy of an ID document.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">In addition, during the enrollment phase, the student is asked to write a short sentence on their keyboard so that their own biometric keystroke profile can be recognized. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">This is done using keystroke dynamics.</span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">Keystroke dynamics is based on the cadence and rhythm of keypress events that are considered unique for each student; however, these events are not directly usable by ML algorithms as they can be spoiled by a series of external random factors, such as interruptions, error corrections, or the use of keyboard special function keys such as </span><em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Shift</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1"> or </span><em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Caps Lock</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">Therefore, it is necessary to transform the corresponding raw data representing user digitations in a dataset of features that correctly represent the user's keyboard dynamics in order to clean up the data from random disturbing factors.</span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">One of the first scientific studies regarding the use of keystroke dynamics for the purpose of anomaly detection is the paper </span><em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Comparing Anomaly-Detection Algorithms for Keystroke Dynamics</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">, by Kevin S. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">Killourhy and Roy A. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.3">Maxion. The authors of the study proposed to collect keystroke dynamics datasets to measure the performance of different detectors; they collected data entered by 51 subjects while typing 400 passwords each, submitting the data collected by 14 different algorithms, which evaluated performance in terms of user detection.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">The purpose of the study was to reliably identify impostors who steal the passwords of other users, based on different typing patterns.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">Impostors who try to authenticate using compromised passwords would be identified and promptly blocked on the basis of the different keystroke dynamics that characterize them compared to genuine users.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">Some of the features that are used to determine keystroke dynamics are as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root"><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">Keydown-keydown</span></strong><span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">: This is the time that elapses </span></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">between the key presses of consecutive keys</span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">From the raw data, the sets of timing features are extracted, which will be fed to the user detection algorithms.</span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">In addition to authentication procedures using keyboard dynamics, authentication methods that use facial recognition are increasingly common.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">These procedures benefit from the growing diffusion of neural networks, as well as the availability of hardware peripherals (such as embedded cameras), which come pre-installed on smartphones and tablets, PCs, and other devices. </span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">Strange as it may seem, the idea of ​​using biometric evidence is not new and can be traced back to less recent times. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">While the use of fingerprints entered the field of police operations at the beginning of the last century, some basic forms of facial recognition date back to posters depicting wanted outlaws, which was very common in the Wild West, to the most recent identikits that are used by investigators.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">There is no doubt, however, that in recent years, we have witnessed a real explosion in the use of biometric evidence; this is not accidental, given the growing spread of threats that are related not only to the use of the internet but also to the national security of countries fighting against terrorism.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">Internet usage has, in many cases, facilitated anonymity, especially in those countries where network access controls are less systematic and reliable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">If the checks that are carried out via IP addresses or through common access credentials consisting of a username and password are not sufficient, they must be complemented by more stringent forms of personal identity verification.</span></p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">In some ways, the use of facial recognition seems to be the preferred choice in the context of biometric procedures; taking advantage of the pervasive diffusion of devices such as smartphones and tablets equipped with high definition cameras, the use of facial recognition would seem to be the most logical and practical solution for verifying identity.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">However, there are some technical aspects that should not be underestimated.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">For facial recognition to constitute a reliable method of identification, it is necessary to ensure that the images used are not distorted by environmental elements (such as reflections, shadows, incident light, and so on), which make it more difficult to use for recognition purposes; the angle of exposure of the face also has its relevance in determining reliability in facial recognition.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">These problems are evident when attempting to use facial recognition on samples of faces extracted from images taken of crowds of individuals; the result is </span><span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">often that the</span></span><span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1"> number of false positives makes the recognition method ineffective.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">The effectiveness and reliability of facial recognition is, therefore, greater when we succeed in using it in a controlled context, in which the potential distortive factors can be reduced to a minimum. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">It is smaller in the case in which we want to use it to make comparisons in the wild (as in the case of spotting individuals amid crowds of people).</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">We must not forget the underlying assumption on which the biometric procedures are based: the uniqueness, that is, the possibility of referring biometric evidence exclusively to a specific individual. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">This assumption is not always verified in the case of facial recognition.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">Apart from the obvious cases of face similarities (as in the case of lookalikes), the same individual can show changes in their face over time, due to physical caused affected by disease, stress, accidents, or simple aging; furthermore, as the population increases, the possibility of encountering spurious correlations increases accordingly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">Due to the simple effect of the case, the amount of data to be taken into consideration to improve the reliability of the recognition procedures then grows disproportionally as the size of the dataset taken into consideration increases.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">All this makes it particularly difficult to reliably train facial recognition algorithms, making the real-time use of facial recognition less practical.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">If we think of the number of comparisons to be issued between the archived evidence and new images that accumulate over time, we immediately realize that an exhaustive verification that compares all possible combinations between them is not feasible.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">As this happens in the field of the recognition of fingerprints, we should reduce the comparisons to just the distinctive features (known as </span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">shinglings</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">) that are probabilistically considered reliable for identification purposes (in the case of fingerprints, these distinctive features take the name of minutiae, that is, areas of the fingerprints in which it is unusual to find evidence such as two ridges merging or a ridge ending) and using appropriate similarity measures, such as </span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">locality-sensitive hashing</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1"> (</span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">LSH</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">).</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">Despite the apparent practicality of facial recognition procedures, they are not free from problems and are related to the high number of false positives they can generate.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">Among the most common facial recognition techniques is the one that goes under the name of </span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Eigenfaces</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">; this name, as we shall see, derives from the procedures used for its implementation, which make use of linear algebra.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">In technical terms, facial recognition is a problem for classification, and consists of combining the names of the faces with the images that correspond to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">We must not confuse facial recognition with facial detection, which is the set of procedures aimed at identifying the presence of a face within an image. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">Being a classification problem, facial recognition presupposes the existence of an archive of images representative of faces, to which we must match a name.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">To this end, we must be able to compare the images in our archive and the new images of individuals to be subjected to facial recognition.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">A direct solution to this problem could consist of reducing the images in as many feature vectors by calculating the reciprocal differences of the features present in the images. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">However, as we mentioned earlier, this approach would be impractical, given the high number of comparisons to be conducted in near real time.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">By their nature, the images are characterized by a high number of </span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">dimensions</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1"> (in the sense of different features) that they may consist of, and which may contain a lot of irrelevant information (constituting </span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">white noise</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">) for the purposes of recognition. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">To make reliable comparisons, we need to reduce the number of dimensions to those strictly relevant for recognition purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">It is, therefore, no coincidence that the facial recognition technology that exploits Eigenfaces is based on an unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithm, known as </span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">principal component analysis</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1"> (</span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">PCA</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">).</span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">PCA makes it possible to identify the representative variables (also called </span><strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">principal components</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">) of a dataset, selecting those along which the data is more spread out.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">To</span><span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1"> </span></span><span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">understand why we need to perform dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data (such as images) and how we can achieve dimensionality reduction using PCA, we can consider the following descriptive example.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">Let's imagine we need to distinguish the nutritional value of foods; which nutrients should we consider among vitamins, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates?</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">To answer this question, we must be able to identify which nutrient acts as the main component, that is, which nutrient (or combination of nutrients) should we consider to be characterizing elements of the various foods?</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">The problem is that not all foods contain the same nutrients (vitamins are more present in vegetables, but not in meat). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">We can then consider as a main component a set of different nutrients, for example by adding to vitamins (present in vegetables) nutrients such as fats (present in meat).</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">We will then add (or remove) nutrients to identify the best combination of elements that can serve as the main component, that is, the component along which the data is the most spread out.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">We must also bear in mind that certain nutrients may be highly correlated, meaning that they move in the same direction, while other nutrients move in the opposite direction (as the presence of vitamins increases, the level of fat is reduced; to measure the degree of correlation, we can use the linear correlation coefficient R).</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">If we can identify elements characterized by a high correlation, we can reduce the number of variables taken into consideration in the definition of the main component; this is exactly the purpose of the PCA: to obtain dimensionality reduction (the reduction of the number of dimensions that characterizes a given dataset).</span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">In formal terms, PCA consists of selecting the hyperplane of space along which the data (represented by points in the space) are mostly spread out; this translates, in mathematical terms, into the search for the axis in which the variance assumes the maximum value. </span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">So, here we come to the application of the PCA technique for facial recognition. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">In the following example, we will associate each image in our archive with the name corresponding to the person represented in the image.</span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">To do this, we need to reduce the dimensionality of the image (consisting of the numerous features corresponding to the different characteristics of the pixels) to the main components, that is, the features most relevant to recognition purposes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">These main components are Eigenfaces.</span></p>
