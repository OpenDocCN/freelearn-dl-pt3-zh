			<h2 id="_idParaDest-11"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>Setting Up Your Environment</h2>
			<p>Before you explore the book in detail, you need to set up specific software and tools. In the following section, you will see how to do that.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-12"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"/>Installing Anaconda on Your System</h3>
			<p>The code for all the exercises and activities in this book can be executed using the Jupyter Notebook. You'll first need to install Anaconda Navigator, which is an interface through which you can access your Jupyter notebooks. Anaconda Navigator will be installed as part of Anaconda Individual Edition, which is an open source Python distribution platform available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Installing Anaconda will also install Python. Head to <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/</a>:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>From the page that opens, click the <strong class="source-inline">Download</strong> button (annotated by <em class="italic">1</em>). Make sure you are downloading the <strong class="source-inline">Individual Edition</strong>.<p> </p><div id="_idContainer011" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B16341_0_03.jpg" alt="Figure 0.3: Anaconda home page&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.3: Anaconda home page</p></li>
				<li>The installer should start downloading immediately. The website will, by default, choose an installer based on your system configuration. If you prefer downloading Anaconda for a different operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and system configuration (32- or 64-bit), click the <strong class="source-inline">Get Additional Installers</strong> link at the bottom of the box (refer to <em class="italic">Figure 0.3</em>). The page should scroll down to a section (refer to <em class="italic">Figure 0.4</em>) that lets you choose from various options based on the operating system and configuration you desire. For this book, it is recommended that you use the latest version of Python (3.8 or higher).<div id="_idContainer012" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B16341_0_04.jpg" alt="Figure 0.4: Downloading Anaconda based on the OS&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.4: Downloading Anaconda based on the OS</p></li>
				<li>Follow the installation steps presented on the screen. <div id="_idContainer013" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B16341_0_05.jpg" alt="Figure 0.5: Anaconda setup&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.5: Anaconda setup</p></li>
				<li>On Windows, if you've never installed Python on your system before, you can select the checkbox that prompts you to add Anaconda to your <strong class="source-inline">PATH</strong>. This will let you run Anaconda-specific commands (like <strong class="source-inline">conda</strong>) from the default command prompt. If you have Python installed or have installed an earlier version of Anaconda in the past, it is recommended that you leave it unchecked (you may run Anaconda commands from the Anaconda Prompt application instead). The installation may take a while depending on your system configuration.<div id="_idContainer014" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B16341_0_06.jpg" alt="Figure 0.6: Anaconda installation steps&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.6: Anaconda installation steps</p><p>For more detailed instructions, you may refer to the official documentation for Linux by clicking this link (<a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/">https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/</a>); for macOS using this link (<a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/">https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/</a>); for Windows using this link (<a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/">https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/</a>). </p></li>
				<li>To check if Anaconda Navigator is correctly installed, look for <strong class="source-inline">Anaconda Navigator</strong> in your applications. Look for an application that has the following icon. Depending on your operating system, the icon's aesthetics may vary slightly.<div id="_idContainer015" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B16341_0_07.jpg" alt="Figure 0.7: Anaconda Navigator icon&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.7: Anaconda Navigator icon</p><p>You can also search for the application using your operating system's search functionality. For example, on Windows 10, you can use the <em class="italic">Windows Key</em> + <em class="italic">S</em> combination and type in <em class="italic">Anaconda Navigator</em>. On macOS, you can use Spotlight search. On Linux, you can open the terminal and type the <strong class="source-inline">anaconda-navigator</strong> command and press the <em class="italic">Return</em> key.</p><div id="_idContainer016" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B16341_0_08.jpg" alt="Figure 0.8: Searching for Anaconda Navigator on Windows 10&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.8: Searching for Anaconda Navigator on Windows 10</p><p>For detailed steps on how to verify if Anaconda Navigator is installed, refer to the following link: <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/verify-install/">https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/verify-install/</a>. </p></li>

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-13"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"/>Launching Jupyter Notebook</h3>
			<p>Once Anaconda Navigator is open, you can launch the Jupyter Notebook interface from this screen. The following steps will show you how to do that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open Anaconda Navigator. You should see the following screen:<div id="_idContainer018" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B16341_0_10.jpg" alt="Figure 0.10: Anaconda Navigator screen&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.10: Anaconda Navigator screen</p></li>
				<li>Now, click <strong class="source-inline">Launch</strong> under the <strong class="source-inline">Jupyter Notebook</strong> panel to start the notebook interface on your local system:<div id="_idContainer019" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B16341_0_11.jpg" alt="Figure 0.11: Jupyter notebook launch option&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.11: Jupyter notebook launch option</p></li>
				<li>On clicking the <strong class="source-inline">Launch</strong> button, you'll notice that even though nothing changes in the window shown in the preceding screenshot, a new tab opens up in your default browser. This is known as the <em class="italic">Notebook Dashboard</em>. It will, by default, open to your root folder. For Windows users, this path would be something similar to <strong class="source-inline">C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;</strong>. On macOS and Linux, it will be <strong class="source-inline">/home/&lt;username&gt;/</strong>.<div id="_idContainer020" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B16341_0_12.jpg" alt="Figure 0.12: Notebook Dashboard&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.12: Notebook Dashboard</p><p>Note that you can also open a Jupyter notebook by simply running the command <strong class="source-inline">jupyter notebook</strong> in the terminal or command prompt. Or, you can search for <strong class="source-inline">Jupyter Notebook</strong> in your applications just like you did in <em class="italic">Figure 0.8</em>. </p></li>
				<li>You can use this dashboard as a file explorer to navigate to the directory where you have downloaded or stored the code files for the book (refer to the <em class="italic">Downloading the Code Bundle</em> section on how to download the files from GitHub). Once you have navigated to your desired directory, you can start by creating a new notebook. Alternatively, if you've downloaded the code from our repository, you can open an existing notebook as well (notebook files will have a <strong class="source-inline">.inpyb</strong> extension). The menus here are quite simple to use: <div id="_idContainer021" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B16341_0_13.jpg" alt="Figure 0.13: Jupyter notebook navigator menu options walk-through&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.13: Jupyter notebook navigator menu options walk-through</p><p>If you make any changes to the directory using your operating system's file explorer and the changed file isn't showing up in the Jupyter Notebook navigator, click the <strong class="source-inline">Refresh Notebook List</strong> button (annotated as <em class="italic">1</em>). To quit, click the <strong class="source-inline">Quit button</strong> (annotated as <em class="italic">2</em>). To create a new file (a new Jupyter notebook), you can click the <strong class="source-inline">New</strong> button (annotated as <em class="italic">3</em>). </p></li>
				<li>Clicking the <strong class="source-inline">New</strong> button will open a dropdown menu as follows:<div id="_idContainer022" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B16341_0_14.jpg" alt="Figure 0.14: Creating a new Jupyter notebook&#13;&#10;"/></div></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.14: Creating a new Jupyter notebook</p>
			<p>You can get started and create your first notebook by selecting <strong class="source-inline">Python 3</strong>; however, it's recommended that you also install the virtual environment we've provided to help you install all the packages required for the title. The following section will show you how to install it.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">A detailed tutorial on the interface and the keyboard shortcuts for Jupyter notebooks can be found here: <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#the-jupyter-notebook">https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#the-jupyter-notebook</a>. </p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-14"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"/>Installing the tensorflow Virtual Environment</h3>
			<p>As you run the code for the exercises and activities, you'll notice that even after installing Anaconda, there are certain libraries that you'll need to install separately as you progress through the book. Then again, you may already have these libraries installed, but their versions may be different from the ones we've used, which may lead to varying results. That's why we've provided an <strong class="source-inline">environment.yml</strong> file with this book that will:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Install all the packages and libraries required for this book at once.</li>
				<li>Make sure that the version numbers of your libraries match the ones we've used to write the code for this book.</li>
				<li>Make sure that the code you write based on this course remains separate from any other coding environment you may have. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>You can download the <strong class="source-inline">environment.yml</strong> file by clicking the following link: <a href="https://packt.link/Z7pcq">https://packt.link/Z7pcq</a>. </p>
			<p>Save this file, ideally in the same folder where you'll be running the code for this book. If you've downloaded the code from GitHub as detailed in the <em class="italic">Downloading the Code Bundle</em> section, this file should already be present in the parent directory, and you won't need to download it separately. </p>
			<p>To set up the environment, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">On macOS, open Terminal from Launchpad (you can find more information about Terminal here: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/terminal/apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac">https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/terminal/apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac</a>). On Linux, open the Terminal application that's native to your distribution. On Windows, you can open Anaconda Prompt instead by simply searching for the application. You can do this by opening the <strong class="source-inline">Start</strong> menu and searching for <strong class="source-inline">Anaconda Prompt</strong>. <div id="_idContainer023" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B16341_0_15.jpg" alt="Figure 0.15: Searching for Anaconda Prompt on Windows&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.15: Searching for Anaconda Prompt on Windows</p><p>A new terminal like the following should open.
