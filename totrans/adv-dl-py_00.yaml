- en: This book is a collection of newly evolved deep learning models, methodologies,
    and implementations based on the areas of their application. In the first section
    of the book, you will learn about the building blocks of deep learning and the
    math behind **neural networks** (**NNs**). In the second section, you'll focus
    on **convolutional neural networks** (**CNNs**) and their advanced applications
    in **computer vision** (**CV**). You'll learn to apply the most popular CNN architectures
    in object detection and image segmentation. Finally, you'll discuss variational
    autoencoders and generative adversarial networks.

- en: In the third section, you'll focus on natural language and sequence processing.
    You'll use NNs to extract sophisticated vector representations of words. You'll
    discuss various types of recurrent networks, such as **long short-term memory**
    (**LSTM**) and **gated recurrent unit** (GRU). Finally, you'll cover the attention
    mechanism to process sequential data without the help of recurrent networks. In
    the final section, you'll learn how to use graph NNs to process structured data.
    You'll cover meta-learning, which allows you to train an NN with fewer training
    samples. And finally, you'll learn how to apply deep learning in autonomous vehicles.

    with deep learning and evolutionary approaches to monitoring and managing deep
    learning models.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for data scientists, deep learning engineers and researchers, and
    AI developers who want to master deep learning and want to build innovative and
    unique deep learning projects of their own. This book will also appeal to those
    who are looking to get well-versed with advanced use cases and the methodologies
    adopted in the deep learning domain using real-world examples. Basic conceptual
    understanding of deep learning and a working knowledge of Python is assumed.

    of Neural Networks*, will briefly introduce what deep learning is and then discuss
    the mathematical underpinnings of NNs. This chapter will discuss NNs as mathematical
    models. More specifically, we''ll focus on vectors, matrices, and differential
    calculus. We''ll also discuss some gradient descent variations, such as Momentum,
    Adam, and Adadelta, in depth. We will also discuss how to deal with imbalanced
    datasets.'
