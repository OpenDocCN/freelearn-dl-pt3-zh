- en: As a result of leveraging deep learning methods such as **convolutional neural
    networks** (**CNNs**), computer vision is attaining new heights in fields including
    health, the automotive sector, social media, and robotics. Whether to automate
    complex tasks, to guide experts in their work, or to help artists in their creative
    process, more and more companies are integrating computer vision solutions.

- en: In this book, we will explore TensorFlow 2, the brand new version of Google's
    open source framework for machine learning. Covering its key features, as well
    as state-of-the-art solutions, we will demonstrate how to efficiently build, train,
    and deploy CNNs for a variety of real-life tasks.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is intended for anyone with some background in Python programming
    and image processing (such as knowing how to read and write image files, and how
    to edit their pixel values). With its gradual learning curve, this book targets
    not only deep learning novices but also experts who are curious about the new
    features of TensorFlow 2.

- en: While some theoretical explanations require knowledge of algebra and calculus,
    concrete examples are provided for learners focused on practical applications.
    Step by step, you will tackle real-life tasks, such as visual recognition for
    self-driving cars and smartphone applications.
