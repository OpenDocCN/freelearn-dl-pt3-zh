- en: Organizations today are spending billions of dollars globally on cybersecurity.
    **Artificial Intelligence** (**AI**) has emerged as a great solution for building
    smarter and safer security systems that allow you to predict and detect suspicious
    network activities, such as phishing or unauthorized intrusions, in your network.

- en: This cybersecurity book presents and demonstrates the popular and successful
    AI approaches and models that you can adopt to detect potential attacks and protect
    your corporate systems. You'll understand the roles of **machine learning** (**ML**)
    and **neural networks** (**NNs**), and deep learning in cybersecurity, and learn
    how you can infuse AI capabilities when building smart defensive mechanisms. As
    you advance, you'll be able to apply these strategies across a variety of applications,
    including spam filters, network intrusion detection, botnet detection, and secure
    authentication.

- en: '[Chapter 1](752acbc8-bc15-44cc-ae83-d023265eeb84.xhtml), *Introduction to AI
    for Cybersecurity Professionals*, introduces the various branches of AI to be
    distinguished between, focusing on the pros and cons of the various approaches
    of automated learning in the field of cybersecurity. This chapter also covers
    the different strategies for learning the algorithms and their optimizations.
    The main concepts of AI will be shown in action using Jupyter Notebooks. The tools
    used in this chapter are Jupyter Notebooks, NumPy, and scikit-learn, and the datasets
    used are scikit-learn datasets and CSV samples.'

    for Cybersecurity Arsenal*, introduces the main software requirements and their
    configurations. We will learn to feed a knowledge base with samples of malicious
    code to feed into AI algorithms. Jupyter Notebooks will be introduced for the
    interactive execution of Python tools and commands. The tools used in this chapter
    are Anaconda, and Jupyter Notebooks. No dataset is used here.'

    Email Cybersecurity Threats with AI*, covers detecting email security threats
    that use email as an attack vector. Different detection strategies, ranging from
    linear classifiers and Bayesian filters to more sophisticated solutions (such
    as decision trees, logistic regression, and **natural language processing** (**NLP**),
    will be illustrated. The examples will make use of the Jupyter Notebooks to allow
    greater interaction of the reader with the different solutions illustrated. The
    tools used in this chapter are Jupyter Notebooks, scikit-learn, and NLTK. The
    datasets used in this regard are the Kaggle spam dataset, CSV spam samples, and
    honeypot phishing samples.'

    introduces a high diffusion of malware and ransomware codes, together with the
    rapid polymorphic mutation in different variants (polymorphic and metamorphic
    malwares) of the same threats that has rendered obsolete traditional detection
    solutions based on signatures and the hashing of image files. It is upon these
    techniques that common antivirus softwares are based. The examples will show the
    different malware analysis strategies that use ML algorithms. The tools used in
    this chapter are Jupyter Notebooks, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. Datasets/samples
    used in this regard include theZoo malware samples.'

    with AI*, explains how the current level of interconnection between different
    devices has attained such complexity that it leads to serious doubts about the
    effectiveness of traditional concepts such as perimeter security. In cyberspace,
    in fact, the attack surface grows exponentially, and it is therefore essential
    to have automated tools for the detection of network anomalies and for learning
    about new potential threats. The tools used in this chapter are Jupyter Notebooks,
    pandas, scikit-learn, and Keras. The datasets used in this regard are Kaggle datasets,
    KDD 1990, CIDDS, CICIDS2017, services, and IDS log files.'

    introduces AI in the field of cybersecurity, which plays an increasingly important
    role in terms of the protection of sensitive user-related information, including
    credentials for access to their network accounts and applications in order to
    prevent abuse, such as identity theft.'

    with Cloud AI Solutions*, covers many of the security attacks and data breaches
    suffered by corporations. Such breaches have as their objective the violation
    of sensitive info, such as customers'' credit cards. Such attacks are often conducted
    in stealth mode, meaning that it is difficult to detect such threats using traditional
    methods. The tools used in this chapter are IBM Watson Studio, IBM Cloud Object
    Storage, Jupyter Notebooks, scikit-learn, Apache Spark. The dataset used here
    is the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.'

    and Defenses*, introduces **Generative Adversarial Networks** (**GANs**) that
    represent the most advanced example of NNs that deep learning makes available
    to us. In the context of cybersecurity, GANs can be used for legitimate purposes,
    as in the case of authentication procedures, but they can also be exploited to
    violate these procedures. The tools used in this chapter are CleverHans, the **Adversarial
    Machine Learning** (**AML**) library, EvadeML-Zoo, TensorFlow, and Keras. The
    datasets used are example images of faces created entirely by using a GAN.'

    this way is it possible to obtain a realistic picture of the effectiveness and
    reliability of the solutions adopted. In addition, the aspects related to the
    scalability of the solutions must be taken into consideration, and then monitored
    continuously to guarantee reliability. The tools used in this chapter are scikit-learn,
    Foolbox, EvadeML, Deep-pwning, TensorFlow, and Keras. The MNIST and scikit datasets
    are used in this regard.'
