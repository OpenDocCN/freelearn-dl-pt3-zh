<p class="mce-root"><span>This book prepares you to use your own custom-trained models with AWS Lambda to achieve a simplified serverless computing approach without spending much time and money. By the end of the book, you will be able to implement a project that demonstrates the use of AWS Lambda in serving TensorFlow models. </span></p>
<p class="mce-root"><span>Furthermore, we will cover deep learning and the TensorFlow framework. We will look at how to train neural networks, but more importantly, we will cover how to use pretrained neural networks in your application and where you can find them. After that, we will look into how to deploy deep learning applications using the serverless approach. We will also cover their advantages, disadvantages, possible limitations, and good practices.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"><span>Later on, we will build a number of applications that will utilize the serverless deep learning approach. We will make a planning API and take a look at the AWS API Gateway service, and explore how to deploy everything in a convenient way. In the later stages, we will make a deep learning pipeline and an AWS simple query service. We will explore how to use it with AWS Lambda and showcase how to deploy the application.</span></p>

<p><a href="c72eddef-e615-4902-957f-72c79b8aaa22.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Beginning with Serverless Computing and AWS Lambda</em><span>, goes through</span><em><span> </span></em><span>all the examples that we are planning to look at. We will also describe the serverless concept and how it has changed the current cloud infrastructure environment. Finally, we will see how serverless deep learning allows us to make projects that are much easier to implement than traditional deployment techniques, while being just as scalable and cheap.</span></p>
<p><a href="135cfd55-ac8e-447d-ba0e-d172955ec3c4.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Starting Deployment with AWS Lambda Functions</em>, <span>introduces AWS Lambda and explains how to create an AWS account. We will make our first Lambda and see how to easily deploy it using the Serverless Framework.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><a href="3d5c687e-d0e7-49b1-9ced-3fc52e0fbff4.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Deploying TensorFlow Models</em>, <span>introduces the TensorFlow framework, along with several examples on how to train and export a model. Also, we will look at the repositories of pretrained models that anyone can use for their own tasks. Finally, we will show how to import pretrained models that is required for your projects.</span></p>
<p><a href="67913362-94d8-4c74-850e-f6b09ca49367.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Working with TensorFlow on AWS Lambda</em>, <span>digs into the specifics of how to start working with serverless TensorFlow. Also, we will see small details of how serverless TensorFlow is different from traditional deployment from the perspective of cost, scale, and speed. We will also look at how to start with using the standard AWS UI, and then understand how the same can be done using the Serverless Framework.</span></p>
<p><a href="af2c1dca-6471-43b6-ba7a-4a41fe30f6dd.xhtml" target="_blank"/><a href="af2c1dca-6471-43b6-ba7a-4a41fe30f6dd.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Creating the Deep Learning API</em>, explains how to make a <span>deep learning REST API</span><span>. Then we will introduce AWS API Gateway and learn how to make the application using two methods: AWS UI and the Serverless Framework.</span></p>
<p><a href="1bf42c9e-262e-472e-9e32-9180d41a53d8.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Creating a Deep Learning Pipeline</em>, explains how to <span>make a deep learning pipeline application. We will introducte AWS SQS and explain how to make the application using two methods: AWS UI and the Serverless Framework.</span></p>

<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre class="packt_figure CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2)<br/>print('Evaluation:')<br/>print(model.evaluate(x_test, y_test))</pre>

<pre><span><strong>npm install -g Serverless</strong><br/><strong>serverless --version</strong><br/></span></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this.
