- en: TensorFlow 2.x, developed by Google, is an end-to-end open source platform for
    machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries,
    and community resources that lets researchers push state-of-the-art ML and developers
    easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.

- en: The independent recipes in this book will teach you how to use TensorFlow for
    complex data computations and allow you to dig deeper and gain more insights into
    your data than ever before. With the help of this book, you will work with recipes
    for training models, model evaluation, regression analysis, tabular data, image
    and text processing and prediction, and much more. You will explore RNNs, CNNs,
    GANs, and reinforcement learning, each using the latest version of Google's machine
    learning library, TensorFlow. Through real-world examples, you will get hands-on
    experience with various data problems and solving techniques using TensorFlow.
    Once you are familiar and comfortable with the TensorFlow ecosystem, you will
    be shown how to take it to production.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 1*, *Getting Started with TensorFlow 2.x*, covers the main objects
    and concepts in TensorFlow. We introduce tensors, variables, and placeholders.
    We also show how to work with matrices and various mathematical operations in
    TensorFlow. At the end of the chapter, we show how to access the data sources
    used in the rest of the book.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 2*, *The TensorFlow Way*, establishes how to connect all the algorithm
    components from *Chapter 1*, *Getting Started with TensorFlow*, into a computational
    graph in multiple ways to create a simple classifier. Along the way, we cover
    computational graphs, loss functions, backpropagation, and training with data.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 3*, *Keras*, focuses on the high-level TensorFlow API named Keras.
    After having introduced the layers that are the building blocks of the models,
    we will cover the Sequential, Functional, and Sub-Classing APIs to create Keras
    models.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 4*, *Linear Regression*, focuses on using TensorFlow for exploring
    various linear regression techniques, such as Lasso and Ridge, ElasticNet, and
    logistic regression. We conclude extending linear models with Wide & Deep. We
    show how to implement each model using estimators.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 5*, *Boosted Trees*, discusses the TensorFlow implementation of boosted
    trees – one of the most popular models for tabular data. We demonstrate the functionality
    by addressing a business problem of predicting hotel booking cancellations.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 6*, *Neural Networks*, covers how to implement neural networks in
    TensorFlow, starting with the operational gates and activation function concepts.
    We then show a shallow neural network and how to build up various different types
    of layers. We end the chapter by teaching a TensorFlow neural network to play
    tic tac toe.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 7*, *Predicting with Tabular Data*, this chapter extends the previous
    one by demonstrating how to use TensorFlow for tabular data. We show how to process
    data handling missing values, binary, nominal, ordinal, and date features. We
    also introduce activation functions like GELU and SELU (particularly effective
    for deep architectures) and the correct usage of cross-validation in order to
    validate your architecture and parameters when you do not have enough data available.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 8*, *Convolutional Neural Networks*, expands our knowledge of neural
    networks by illustrating how to use images with convolutional layers (and other
    image layers and functions). We show how to build a shortened CNN for MNIST digit
    recognition and extend it to color images in the CIFAR-10 task. We also illustrate
    how to extend prior-trained image recognition models for custom tasks. We end
    the chapter by explaining and demonstrating the StyleNet/neural style and DeepDream
    algorithms in TensorFlow.'

    type (RNN) that has been instrumental in achieving state-of-the-art results on
    different modes of sequential data; applications presented include time-series
    prediction and text sentiment analysis.'

- en: '*Chapter 10*, *Transformers*, is dedicated to Transformers – a new class of
    deep learning models that have revolutionized the field of **Natural Language
    Processing** (**NLP**). We demonstrate how to leverage their strength for both
    generative and discriminative tasks.'

    the TensorFlow library dedicated to reinforcement learning. The structured approach
    allows us to handle problems ranging from simple games to content personalization
    in e-commerce.'

- en: '*Chapter 12*, *Taking TensorFlow to Production*, gives tips and examples on
    moving TensorFlow to a production environment and how to take advantage of multiple
    processing devices (for example, GPUs) and setting up TensorFlow distributed on
    multiple machines. We also show the various uses of TensorBoard, and how to view
    computational graph metrics and charts. We end the chapter by showing an example
    of setting up an RNN model on TensorFlow serving an API.'
