    including connected healthcare, smart home, and smart city. Although IoT applications are
    exciting, there are significant scientific and technological challenges to be
    overcome before they can be fully realized. One of the key technical challenges
    for IoT is the design and development of **Deep Learning** (**DL**) models that
    work well in resource-constrained IoT devices or edge/fog computing devices, and
    those that meet the real-time response requirements. In this final chapter, we
    shall first present a summary of the earlier chapters, and then use examples to
    discuss the main challenges faced by the existing DL techniques in their development
    and implementation of resource-constrained and embedded IoT environments. Finally,
    we will summarize a few existing solutions and point out some potential solutions
    that can fill the gaps for DL-based IoT analytics.

    streaming data. Analysis of such big data or data streams is crucial to learning
    new information, predicting future insights, and making informed decisions. Machine
    learning, including DL, is a key technology for this analysis. The use of DL models
    in IoT applications for data analysis has been making progress recently. However,
    an overall application view of DL models in the IoT landscape is missing. In this
    book, we have made an effort to fill this gap by presenting IoT applications from
    various domains and their DL-based implementations.

    applications, and a three-layered, end-to-end view of IoT solutions, which is
    useful for knowing and applying DL-based data analysis in the IoT ecosystem. We
    presented an overview of DL and its popular models and implementation frameworks,
    including TensorFlow and Keras. In the remaining chapters (3-9), we presented
    various generic services provided by DL models (such as image processing) in different
    IoT application domains through various use cases. The following table summarizes
    those chapters in terms of key activities in each chapter:'

    One potential reason could be that CNN models perform very well on image datasets,
    and most datasets are either images or can be converted into an image (such as
    voice data). The model performance presented in the table, as well as in the chapters
    themselves, are not final performance values; rather, they are indicative performance
    values, as DL models are sensitive to the structure and size of data. Changes
    in datasets and/or the structure of the DL architecture may alter DL models' performance.
    Generally, DL models work well on large datasets with a wide range of features
    compared to their shallow counterparts.

    implementations, demonstrate the potential of DL in IoT, there are still some
    open research challenges in many directions. In particular, research and development
    support are needed in many areas. A few of the key areas of research and development
    are dataset preprocessing, secure, and privacy-aware DL, aspects of handling big
    data, and resource-efficient training and learning. In the following sections,
    we briefly present these remaining challenges from a machine learning perspective,

    DL for their data analysis. Unfortunately, most of these existing works, including
    this book, rely on datasets for model training and testing that are not from IoT
    applications and/or real-life applications. One of the consequences of this is
    that many IoT-specific issues are not significantly reflected in the models. For
    example, IoT devices are more prone to hardware failure than general-purpose computing
    devices. In this case, the use of general-purpose computing data in IoT use cases
    may provide an incorrect prediction of an incident. Furthermore, hardware failure
    could be reported as a security incident. In addition, most of these datasets
    are not sufficiently large enough to overcome overfitting.'

    and acceptance of IoT analytics based on DL. Datasets are a key requirement for
    the empirical validation and evaluation that the IoT system will work in the real
    world with no or minimal issues. Accessibility to the available datasets is another
    big problem that many people are facing, including us in this book. Healthcare
    and human activity detections are big application domains of IoT; however, their
    related data is usually copyrighted or under privacy considerations, restricting
    us from using the data with complete freedom. Many web resources have compiled
    a general list of useful datasets. A similar type of collection would be of a
    lot of help to IoT application developers and researchers.

    data into a suitable representation to be fed into DL models. Unlike many other
    application areas of DL, this is a challenge in IoT applications as IoT sensor-
    and/or thing-generated data are in different formats. For example, consider a
    remote patient-monitoring IoT application. The application needs to use various
    sensors, and they generate data in different formats. To use that data and make
    a collective and correct decision about the patient, we need to preprocess the
    data before applying it to a DL model.'

    challenge for IoT. Consequently, most IoT applications are working on guaranteeing
    data security and privacy in the end-to-end life cycle of data. Most of the time,
    IoT big data will be communicated through the internet to the cloud for DL-based
    analysis and can thus be seen by the people or devices around the world. Many
    existing applications rely on data anonymization for privacy; these techniques
    are not hacker-proof. Interestingly, most people talk about security and privacy
    of data produced by IoT devices, but what about the security of the operations,
    including machine learning and DL running on that data? In fact, DL training models
    can also under go various malicious attacks, including **False Data Injection**
    (**FDI**) or anomalous sample inputs. Through these attacks, many functional or
    non-functional requirements of the IoT solution could be in serious danger, or
    they may make the solution useless or even dangerous for the intended target.
    As a result, machine learning and DL, models need to be equipped with a mechanism
    to discover abnormal or invalid data. A data monitoring DL model on top of the
    main model could be a potential solution here. Further research and developments
    are necessary for security solutions to defend and prevent the DL models against
    these attacks and make the IoT applications useful and reliable.'

    challenges to DL for IoT. Every feature of IoT big data (the six V''s: volume,

    of time and structural complexity. Time is a serious concern in a real-time IoT
    application. The huge amount of input data, its heterogenous attributes, and its
    classification variability may require a highly complex DL model that may need
    longer running time and huge computing resources that are not available in most
    IoT applications. DL models are generally good at handling noisy and unlabelled
    during model learning. However, IoT's huge volume of noisy and unlabeled data
    may face issues.

    and/or devices can be an issue for DL models in IoT applications. This could be
    a serious problem if these sources conflict with one another. Many IoT applications
    produce continuous and real-time data, and they need real-time responses, which
    may not always be possible in IoT devices. Stream-based online learning is a potential
    solution. However, further research is required to integrate online and sequential
    learning approaches for DL models to address the velocity issue of the data in
    IoT.

    driverless cars, and the smart electrical grid, is an obligatory requirement that
    could pose challenges for DL models in IoT. Lack of authentic data could make
    the IoT big data analytics useless. Hence, data validation and authenticity need
    to be checked at every level of data analysis. The data variability, such as data
    flow rates, could cause additional challenges for the online processing of streaming
    data.

    capability of DL models is an issue for many IoT applications, as they need some
    kind of regression as their core analysis component. Few works already propose
    solutions for the regression capability integration within DL models. We need
    further research in this direction.
