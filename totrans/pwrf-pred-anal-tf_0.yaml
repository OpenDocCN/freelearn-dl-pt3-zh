- en: Predictive analytics discovers hidden patterns from structured and unstructured
    data for automated decision making in business intelligence. Predictive decisions
    are becoming a huge trend worldwide, catering to wide industry sectors by predicting
    which decisions are more likely to give maximum results. Data mining, statistics,
    and machine learning allow users to discover predictive intelligence by uncovering
    patterns and showing the relationship between structured and unstructured data.

    and then into actionable intelligence. This fact makes machine learning well suited
    to the predictive analytics. Without machine learning, therefore, it would be
    nearly impossible to keep up with these massive streams of information altogether.

    continent. When it comes to learning, a roadmap helps you in giving a definitive
    path for progressing towards the goal. So, here you're presented with a roadmap
    before you begin your journey.

- en: '[Lesson 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. From Data to Decisions – Getting Started with
    TensorFlow"), *From Data to Decisions – Getting Started with TensorFlow*, provides
    a detailed description of the main TensorFlow features in a real-life problem,
    followed by detailed discussions about TensorFlow installation and configuration.
    It then covers computation graphs, data, and programming models before getting
    started with TensorFlow. The last part of the lesson contains an example of implementing
    linear regression model for predictive analytics.'

    for Predictive Analytics"), *Putting Data in Place – Supervised Learning for Predictive
    Analytics*, covers some TensorFlow-based supervised learning techniques from a
    theoretical and practical perspective. In particular, the linear regression model
    for regression analysis will be covered on a real dataset. It then shows how you
    could solve the Titanic survival problem using logistic regression, random forests,
    and SVMs for predictive analytics.'

    for Predictive Analytics"), *Clustering Your Data – Unsupervised Learning for
    Predictive Analytics*, digs deeper into predictive analytics and finds out how
    you can take advantage of it to cluster records belonging to the certain group
    or class for a dataset of unsupervised observations. It will then provide some
    practical examples of unsupervised learning. Particularly, clustering techniques
    using TensorFlow will be discussed with some hands-on examples.'

    Analytics"), *Using Reinforcement Learning for Predictive Analytics*, talks about
    designing machine learning systems driven by criticism and rewards. It will show
    several examples on how to apply reinforcement learning algorithms for developing
    predictive models on real-life datasets.'
