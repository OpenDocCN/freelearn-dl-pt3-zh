    Please note that the use of a GPU is highly recommended. It will cut down the
    training times of complex models from days to hours.

    packages. These packages may not be available through `conda`. We will use `pip`
    in such cases.

    installed was 0.9.5\. Note that this version of Snorkel uses older versions of
    pandas and TensorBoard. You should be able to safely ignore any warnings about
    mismatched versions for the purposes of the code in this book. However, if you
    continue to face conflicts in your environment, then I suggest creating a separate
    Snorkel-specific `conda` environment.
