<p>This section covers the fundamentals of computer vision and deep learning, with the help of concrete TensorFlow examples. Starting with a presentation of these technical domains, the first chapter will then walk you through the inner workings of neural networks. This section continues with an introduction to the instrumental features of TensorFlow 2 and Keras, and their key concepts and ecosystems. It ends with a description of machine learning techniques adopted by computer vision experts.</p>
