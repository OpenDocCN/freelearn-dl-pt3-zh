    provides essential techniques for those who want to apply computer vision to novel
    use cases. First, TensorFlow tools that are designed to process large amounts
    of data in an efficient manner are presented. Tackling the opposite scenario,
    where data is too scarce, you will also be introduced to domain adaptation, as
    well as image generation with computer graphics, GANs, and VAEs. To learn how
    to extract information from videos, a chapter is dedicated to recurrent neural
    networks, their theory, and some illustrated applications. Finally, the book ends
    with a discussion about the challenges related to on-device computer vision, teaching
    you how to deploy your solutions on mobile phones and in web browsers.
