<p>The use of IoT will be come omnipresent in our life through various applications, including connected healthcare, smart home, and smart city. Although IoT applications are exciting, there are significant scientific and technological challenges to be overcome before they can be fully realized. One of the key technical challenges for IoT is the design and development of <strong>Deep Learning</strong> (<strong>DL</strong>) models that work well in resource-constrained IoT devices or edge/fog computing devices, and those that meet the real-time response requirements. In this final chapter, we shall first present a summary of the earlier chapters, and then use examples to discuss the main challenges faced by the existing DL techniques in their development and implementation of resource-constrained and embedded IoT environments. Finally, we will summarize a few existing solutions and point out some potential solutions that can fill the gaps for DL-based IoT analytics.</p>
<p>The topics that we will cover in this chapter are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>What have we done in this book?</li>
<li>Challenges in design and the development of DL models for resource-constrained IoT devices</li>

<p><strong> </strong>Most IoT applications are generating—and will generate—big or fast/real-time streaming data. Analysis of such big data or data streams is crucial to learning new information, predicting future insights, and making informed decisions. Machine learning, including DL, is a key technology for this analysis. The use of DL models in IoT applications for data analysis has been making progress recently. However, an overall application view of DL models in the IoT landscape is missing. In this book, we have made an effort to fill this gap by presenting IoT applications from various domains and their DL-based implementations.</p>
<p>In the first chapter of the book, we presented an overview of IoT, its key applications, and a three-layered, end-to-end view of IoT solutions, which is useful for knowing and applying DL-based data analysis in the IoT ecosystem. We presented an overview of DL and its popular models and implementation frameworks, including TensorFlow and Keras. In the remaining chapters (3-9), we presented various generic services provided by DL models (such as image processing) in different IoT application domains through various use cases. The following table summarizes those chapters in terms of key activities in each chapter:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926 image-border" src="assets/c68182e0-8087-4102-8a67-07bd69b237cc.png" style="width:95.83em;height:58.50em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>As we can see from the table, CNNs and its variants are used in most cases. One potential reason could be that CNN models perform very well on image datasets, and most datasets are either images or can be converted into an image (such as voice data). The model performance presented in the table, as well as in the chapters themselves, are not final performance values; rather, they are indicative performance values, as DL models are sensitive to the structure and size of data. Changes in datasets and/or the structure of the DL architecture may alter <span><span>DL models'</span></span> performance. Generally, DL models work well on large datasets with a wide range of features compared to their shallow counterparts.</p>

<p>Although the IoT application use cases, presented herein with their DL-based implementations, demonstrate the potential of DL in IoT, there are still some open research challenges in many directions. In particular, research and development support are needed in many areas. A few of the key areas of research and development are dataset preprocessing, secure, and privacy-aware DL, aspects of handling big data, and resource-efficient training and learning. In the following sections, we briefly present these remaining challenges from a machine learning perspective, as well as from the perspective of IoT devices, edge/fog computing, and the cloud.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Recently, machine learning and DL techniques are being used in various application domains <span>to make informed decisions. However, there are a few challenges that are specific to machine learning and DL. These are as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The lack of Large IoT datasets</strong>: Many IoT application domains are adopting DL for their data analysis. Unfortunately, most of these existing works, including this book, rely on datasets for model training and testing that are not from IoT applications and/or real-life applications. One of the consequences of this is that many IoT-specific issues are not significantly reflected in the models. For example, IoT devices are more prone to hardware failure than general-purpose computing devices. In this case, the use of general-purpose computing data in IoT use cases may provide an incorrect prediction of an incident. Furthermore, hardware failure could be reported as a security incident. In addition, most of these datasets are not sufficiently large enough to overcome overfitting. </li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">All these dataset-related issues are an important obstacle to the deployment and acceptance of IoT analytics based on DL. Datasets are a key requirement for the empirical validation and evaluation that the IoT system will work in the real world with no or minimal issues. Accessibility to the available datasets is another big problem that many people are facing, including us in this book. Healthcare and human activity detections are big application domains of IoT; however, their related data is usually copyrighted or under privacy considerations, restricting us from using the data with complete freedom. Many web resources have compiled a general list of useful datasets. A similar type of collection would be of a lot of help to IoT application developers and researchers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preprocessing</strong>:<strong> </strong>Preprocessing is an essential step in DL that processes raw data into a suitable representation to be fed into DL models. Unlike many other application areas of DL, this is a challenge in IoT applications as IoT sensor- and/or thing-generated data are in different formats. For example, consider a remote patient-monitoring IoT application. The application needs to use various sensors, and they generate data in different formats. To use that data and make a collective and correct decision about the patient, we need to preprocess the data before applying it to a DL model.</li>
<li><strong>Secure and privacy preserving DL</strong>:<strong> </strong>Security and privacy is the number one challenge for IoT. Consequently, most IoT applications are working on guaranteeing data security and privacy in the end-to-end life cycle of data. Most of the time, IoT big data will be communicated through the internet to the cloud for DL-based analysis and can thus be seen by the people or devices around the world. Many existing applications rely on data anonymization for privacy; these techniques are not hacker-proof. Interestingly, most people talk about security and privacy of data produced by IoT devices, but what about the security of the operations, including machine learning and DL running on that data? In fact, DL training models can also under go various malicious attacks, including <strong>False Data Injection</strong> (<strong>FDI</strong>) or anomalous sample inputs. Through these attacks, many functional or non-functional requirements of the IoT solution could be in serious danger, or they may make the solution useless or even dangerous for the intended target. As a result, machine learning and DL, models need to be equipped with a mechanism to discover abnormal or invalid data. A data monitoring DL model on top of the main model could be a potential solution here. Further research and developments are necessary for security solutions to defend and prevent the DL models against these attacks and make the IoT applications useful and reliable.</li>
<li><strong>Big data issues (The six Vs)</strong>:<strong> </strong>IoT applications are one of the big contributors to the big data generation. Hence, challenges faced by DL for big data are also challenges to DL for IoT. Every feature of IoT big data (the six V's: volume, variety, veracity, velocity, variability, and value) imposes a challenge for DL techniques. In the following points, we briefly discuss their challenges.</li>
<li>The <span>huge volume of data poses a tremendous pressure for DL, especially in terms of time and structural complexity. Time is a serious concern in a real-time IoT application. The huge amount of input data, its heterogenous attributes, and its classification variability may require a highly complex DL model that may need longer running time and huge computing resources that are not available in most IoT applications. DL models are generally good at handling noisy and unlabelled during model learning. However, IoT's huge volume of noisy and unlabeled data may face issues.</span></li>
<li>The heterogeneity (variety) of IoT data formats coming from heterogenous sources and/or devices can be an issue for DL models in IoT applications. This could be a serious problem if these sources conflict with one another. Many IoT applications produce continuous and real-time data, and they need real-time responses, which may not always <span>be</span><span> </span><span>possible in IoT devices. Stream-based online learning is a potential solution. However, further research is required to integrate online and sequential learning approaches for DL models to address the velocity issue of the data in IoT.</span></li>
<li>The authenticity (veracity) of data in many applications, such as medical care, driverless cars, and the smart electrical grid, is an obligatory requirement that could pose challenges for DL models in IoT. Lack of authentic data could make the IoT big data analytics useless. Hence, data validation and authenticity need to be checked at every level of data analysis. The data variability, such as data flow rates, could cause additional challenges for the online processing of streaming <span>data.</span></li>
<li>Finally, having a clear understanding of business value of an IoT adoption and its corresponding big data is essential. However, most decision makers fail to understand that value.<strong> </strong></li>

<p>Even with tremendous success in various application domains, DL models have many issues to be addressed in the future. For example, any false claim made by a DL model that is not recognizable by humans is an issue. Lack of regression capability of DL models is an issue for many IoT applications, as they need some kind of regression as their core analysis component. Few works already propose solutions for the regression capability integration within DL models. We need further research in this direction.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As we mentioned in <a href="7781d6f5-c3e4-4bf8-a9f2-9c3fc63caeeb.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>The End-to-End Life Cycle of IoT</em>, an end-to-end IoT solution consists of three different key components or layers, which mainly includes IoT devices, edge/fog computing, and cloud platforms. All these components have their own challenges in regard to DL implementations. In the following list, we will briefly discuss those challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource-constrained IoT Devices</strong>:<strong> </strong>IoT devices are resource-constrained in terms of processors, battery energy, memory, and network connectivity. DL models developed for traditional computers may not be directly useful in IoT devices. Importantly, the training of DL models is not possible in IoT devices as the training process is a resource-hungry operation. For this book, all the DL models' training was done on a powerful desktop computer or the cloud. In some cases, resources are so scarce that a pre-trained model may not run on them for inferencing. As shown in the following screenshot, the two versions of CNN implementations discussed in <a href="b28129e7-3bd1-4f83-acf7-4567e5198efb.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Image Recognition in IoT</em>, for image classification need around 90 MB to store their pre-trained models, and this storage may not be available in many IoT devices. <span>Hence, we need lightweight DL models, especially lightweight pre-trained DL models. A number of existing solutions are available for addressing the IoT device-related issues, and we shall briefly cover these </span><span>in the next section:</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927 image-border" src="assets/18d14204-ff72-4910-b992-8e95265067b7.png" style="width:82.17em;height:24.08em;"/></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edge/fog computing</strong>:<strong> </strong>Edge/fog computing is becoming a popular computing platform in IoT solutions, especially for real-time applications, as the data used in these applications does not need to always be moved to a cloud platform. However, this technology is in its early stages and has many challenges, including the following ones:
<ul>
<li><strong>DL service discovery for devices</strong>: Edge/fog routers or gateways will be distributed geographically, and will offer services to IoT end users/nodes using a specific DL model. For example, a <strong>fog node</strong> may offer image classification services through a CNN, and another nearby node may offer an intrusion detection service using LSTM. In this context, devices need service discovery protocols that can efficiently discover their appropriate data analytics services based on their needs and context.</li>
<li><strong>DL model and task distribution</strong>: Fog computing may rely on a distributed learning approach by sharing the learning responsibility between different fog/edge nodes. This will require some time to split the DL model execution process, as well as their tasks distribution, which could be an issue for real-time IoT applications.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile devices as edge devices</strong>: Smart mobile phones are omnipresent, and are becoming a key element in the IoT ecosystem. However, the dynamic nature of these devices in terms of joining/leaving the network is a challenge for the DL-based analysis services relying on them, as they can leave the network at any time. In addition, their energy usage and other accurate resource-related information needs to be available at the task distributor in order to assign them appropriate tasks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cloud computing:</strong> The cloud is an essential computing platform for IoT big data analytics. However, its response time and legal/policy restrictions (such as data, which may need to move from a security boundary) can be an issue for many IoT applications. In addition, security and privacy of IoT data during processing and in storage is a concern for many IoT applications.</li>
</ul>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Existing solutions to support DL in resource-constrained IoT devices </h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Generally, DL models require calculations of ultra-large (in the range of millions to billions) numbers of parameter, which necessitates a powerful computing platform with huge storage support, which is not available in IoT devices or platforms. Fortunately, there are existing methods and technologies (this is not used in this book, as we did the model training on a desktop) that can address a few of the aforementioned issues in IoT devices and thus support DL on them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DL network compression</strong>: DL networks are generally dense and require huge computational power and memory that may not be available in IoT devices. This is required even to do the inferencing and/or classification. DL network compression, which converts a dense network into a sparse network, is a potential solution for resource-constrained IoT devices. A number of existing services, including Mobilenet V1 &amp; V2, have tested the technology. For example, the Incentive V3 architecture of CNNs can be compressed from 87.0 MB of storage to 17.0 MB (as we demonstrated in <span><a href="b28129e7-3bd1-4f83-acf7-4567e5198efb.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Image Recognition in IoT</em></span>) using the Mobilenet V1 architecture. However, the approach is still not generic enough to be used for all DL models, and a compression technique may need specific hardware in order to carry out the operation.</li>
<li><strong>Approximate computing for DL</strong>: This approach works by <span>considering</span> the predictions as part of a range of acceptable values rather than an exact value (such as 95% accuracy), as many IoT applications may not need the exact values. For example, many event detection applications only require the event to be detected, not an exact value of the prediction accuracy of the event. Approximate computing will save energy, but this is not suitable for critical applications (such as medical care) where exact values are needed.</li>
<li><strong>Accelerators</strong>: Hardware-based accelerators for DL models have been gaining some research and development attention recently. Special hardware and circuits can be used to minimize memory footprint and improve energy efficiency to run DL models on IoT devices. In addition, software acceleration can be used for this. However, accelerators may not work with traditional IoT hardware.</li>
<li><strong>Tinymotes</strong>: Researchers are working on developing tiny-sized nodes that run on batteries and do the DL based on-board data analysis through the support hardware accelerator. These are useful for real-time applications. However, they are for special-purpose DL networks, and security is an issue for them.<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In this section, we shall briefly discuss a few potential research and development solutions in order to address some of the issues mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distributed learning</strong>: In this book, the model learning or training were done centrally, but this may not be feasible in many IoT applications. In this context, distributed learning can be a potential solution. However, distributed computing has a security problem, and this can be minimized through <em>Blockchain-based Distributed Learning</em>.</li>
<li><strong>IoT mobile data</strong>: Smartphones are a key contributor of IoT proliferation. Efficient solutions for mobile big data analysis through DL models can offer better IoT services in various application domains, including smart cities. This area needs further research.</li>
<li><strong>Integration of contextual information</strong>: Contextual information is essential for correctly using and interpreting DL-based data analysis. However, it is hard to understand the environmental contexts of an IoT application using IoT sensor data. Ambient sensor data fused with IoT-application sensor data can provide contextual information. Hence, developing DL-based solutions integrated with contextual information could be another future direction.</li>
<li><strong>Online resource provisioning in edge/fog computing</strong>: <span>Demand for edge/fog computing resources could be dynamic for real-time data analysis on streaming IoT data. Hence, online or demand-driven resource provisioning is necessary to provide data analysis services for diverse IoT applications. A few proposals are available for this, but they are focused on specific application domains. Further research is necessary for wider IoT applications.</span><strong> </strong></li>
<li><strong>Semi-supervised data analysis frameworks</strong>: Supervised data analysis needs a large quantity of labelled data that may not always be available for many IoT applications. Often, we will have more unlabeled data than labelled data. Therefore, a semi-supervised framework could be a better option. A few initiatives are available, and further work is necessary to support the adoption of this solution.</li>
<li><strong>Secure DL models</strong>: DL-based data analysis will only be useful if it operates correctly and their non-functional properties (such as trustworthiness and availability) are maintained. However, DL models can be the target of various malicious attacks, making them vulnerable. Very limited research and development is available in this area. This could be a potential research and development direction.</li>
