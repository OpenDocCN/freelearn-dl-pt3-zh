    a deep learning project. We have completed two basic end-to-end projects in previous
    chapters using the Keras and TensorFlow.js libraries. We have become familiar
    with Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and Keras, and we have also seen
    how deep learning models can be developed using JavaScript. We have also used
    the Flask framework to create an API out of a deep learning model. In [chapter
    4](e9f25c1c-0665-4c87-9c74-15824b2e6d41.xhtml), *Getting Started with TensorFlow.js*,
    we used third-party **Application Programming Interfaces** (**APIs**) to create
    a web application.

    at all APIs that are relevant to deep learning. We will first look at some of
    the most widely known deep learning APIs, and then we will look at some lesser-known
    deep learning APIs. We will also learn how to choose a deep learning API provider.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Imagine that you are working on a web application that needs an image recognition
    module to be integrated into it. But you are not into computer vision and deep
    learning. You have a very strict deadline to meet for the project. You cannot
    afford to commit to studying deep learning and then complete the project's image
    recognition module. What should you do now? Will your project be completed by
    the specified deadline?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It definitely won't! However, with the power of APIs, you will be able to easily
    integrate the image recognition module into your web application. Let's now discuss
    the concept of APIs in a bit more detail.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An API is a set of functions (although technically an API can consist of just
    one function) that can be integrated into an application to perform certain tasks.
    Often, as developers, there are specific utilities from our favorite websites
    that we wish to integrate into our own applications. For example, Twitter provides
    an API for retrieving tweets that match a certain keyword. We can use this API
    to collect data, analyze it, and eventually come up with interesting insights
    about data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Companies such as Facebook, Google, Stack Overflow, and LinkedIn provide APIs
    for certain tasks, and it is really worth checking them out as a developer. APIs
    are virtually analogous to websites. When we click on something in a website,
    we are redirected to another page/section. In most cases, we get a web page as
    the output. But APIs generally do not produce a good-looking web page as their
    output. APIs are meant to be used from within the code, and the output of an API
    is generally in some popular data interchange format, such as JSON or XML. The
    output is then processed accordingly with respect to the application for which
    the API is used. An API lets you do the tasks you want to do by providing a suite
    of utilities or an ecosystem without you having to worry about the details.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can test an API nowadays without having to write one bit of code. For example,
    you can use an API client such as Postman and test an open API that you really
    like, and no code is required to be written in order to do that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is even more magical about APIs is that you can write code, for example,
    in Java and use an API developed in Python. This is particularly useful when you
    are working in a team where people are very particular about the different programming
    languages they use. One of your teammates might be very comfortable working with
    Java while another teammate may be a Python expert. So, the whole concept of APIs
    really comes in handy in these situations.

    Google AI, Facebook AI Research, and others shortly. We will see how these APIs

    together on industry-standard technology and research tools that may not be available
    to all developers. Also, the models deployed through commercial APIs are often
    very stable to use and provide state-of-the-art features, including scalability,
    customization, and accuracy. So, if you're facing accuracy issues, which is a
    common situation in the production of deep learning models, choosing an API is
    a good choice.

    tough when the person who coded it in the first place leaves without producing
    proper documentation and a new person has to pick up where they left off. Commercial
    APIs define a set standard of operations, and applications built with such APIs
    integrated into them are easy to maintain because API providers also always include
    extensive documentation, meaning developers can learn about the APIs beforehand.

    to improve deep learning models once they have got a first version running, especially
    if their entire business model isn't particularly centered on artificial intelligence.
    Any such use case would benefit greatly from API usage because APIs are maintained
    by people who push regular updates and new features.

    once and then be used for years without ever having to think about the APIs again.

    many similarities between the two, but they are different in many aspects. Much
    like an API, a library also provides a collection of functions and classes that
    can be used as per your needs. The following are some pointers that will help
    you to distinguish between a library and an API:'

    cannot use the SciPy Python library if you are using a PHP programming environment.
    However, you can develop an API that uses SciPy and then consume the API using
    your PHP code.
  prefs:

    ways to how libraries are. Many APIs enforce some kind of authentication before
    a developer can actually use them. We do not see this very often when it comes
    to using a library. You can easily override and overload a library function or
    class and use it as you will.

    role in deciding which provider you use. A certain provider may have a comfortable
    limit on the number of free API calls for experimentation and so might be a lucrative
    option for you. Often, experimenting developers and students choose to go with
    the provider that has the best offering in terms of cost.

    little which provider is used, since they all provide similar performance for
    small- to medium-scale usage.
