- en: TensorFlow has transformed the way machine learning is perceived. *TensorFlow
    Machine Learning Projects* teaches you how to exploit the benefits—simplicity,
    efficiency, and flexibility—of using TensorFlow in various real-world projects.
    With the help of this book, you'll not only learn how to build advanced projects
    using different datasets, but also be able to tackle common challenges using a
    range of libraries from the TensorFlow ecosystem.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To begin with, you'll get to grips with using TensorFlow for machine learning
    projects. You'll explore a wide range of projects using TensorForest and TensorBoard
    for detecting exoplanets, TensorFlow.js for sentiment analysis, and TensorFlow
    Lite for digit classification.

- en: As you make your way through the book, you'll build projects in various real-world
    domains incorporating **natural language processing** (**NLP**), the Gaussian
    process, autoencoders, recommender systems, and Bayesian neural networks, along
    with trending areas such as **generative adversarial networks** (**GANs**), capsule
    networks, and reinforcement learning. You'll learn to use TensorFlow with the
    Spark API and explore GPU-accelerated computing with TensorFlow in order to detect
    objects, followed by understanding how to train and develop a **recurrent neural
    network** (**RNN**) model to generate book scripts.
