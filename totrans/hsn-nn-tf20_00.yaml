- en: Technology leaders are adopting neural networks to enhance their products, making
    them smarter or, in marketing words, AI-powered. This book is a handy guide to
    TensorFlow, its inner structure, the new features of version 2.0 and how to use
    them to create neural-networks-based applications. By the end of this book, you
    will be well-versed in the TensorFlow architecture and its new features. You will
    be able to solve machine learning problems easily, using the power of neural networks.

- en: This book starts with a theoretical overview of machine learning and neural
    networks, followed by a description of the TensorFlow library, in both its 1.x
    and 2.0 versions. Reading this book, you will become well-versed in the required
    theory for understanding how neural networks work, using easy-to-follow examples.
    Next, you will learn how to master optimization techniques and algorithms to build
    a wide range of neural network architectures using the new modules offered by
    TensorFlow 2.0\. Furthermore, after having analyzed the TensorFlow structure,
    you will learn how to implement more complex neural network architectures such
    as CNNs for classification, semantic segmentation networks, generative adversarial
    networks, and others in your research work and projects.

    the fundamentals of machine learning: what supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised
    learning is and why these distinctions are important. Moreover, you will start
    to understand how to create a data pipeline, how to measure the performance of
    an algorithm, and how to validate your results.'

    Deep Learning*, focuses on neural networks. You will learn about the strengths
    of machine learning models, how it is possible to make a network learn, and how,
    in practice, the model parameter update is performed. By the end of this chapter,
    you will understand the intuition behind backpropagation and network parameter
    updates. Moreover, you''ll learn why deep neural network architectures are required
    to solve challenging tasks.'
