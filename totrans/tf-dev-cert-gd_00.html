<p>There is an ever-growing need for deep learning experts across the globe and TensorFlow is a leading framework for building deep learning applications. To meet the growing demand for developers with the requisite skills to build deep learning applications across various domains, the TensorFlow Developer Certificate was established. This 5-hour, hands-on exam is designed to test a developer’s foundational knowledge in building, training, saving, and debugging models in computer vision, natural language processing, time series, sequences <span class="No-Break">and predictions.</span></p>
<p>This book serves as a comprehensive guide in preparing you for this exam. You will begin by understanding the fundamentals of machine learning and the exam in itself. With each chapter, you will acquire new skills with hands-on coding examples and exercises in which you master the science and art of model building for image classification, natural language processing and time <span class="No-Break">series forecasting.</span></p>
<p>By the end of this book, you will be well equipped with all the nuts and bolts to effectively ace this exam in <span class="No-Break">one sitting.</span></p>
