- en: In this section we will learn how to develop a DL solution for the predictive
    maintenance of IoT using the Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation dataset. Moving
    on, in this section, we will examine how we can use DL-based IoT solutions in
    the field of healthcare and discuss two use cases in detail, looking at where
    healthcare services can be improved and/or automatized using DL-supported IoT
    solutions. Then, we will look at different challenges faced by existing DL techniques
    in IoT, especially in resource-constrained and embedded IoT devices, and introduce
    ourselves to a few future solution directions in order to address the remaining
    issues.
