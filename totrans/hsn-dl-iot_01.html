<p>In this section, we will have an overview of <span>IoT ecosystems, the key characteristics of IoT data (that is, real-time big data). We explain why analytics is necessary for data and why <strong>deep learning</strong> (<strong>DL</strong>) is important for analysis. We will also look into </span><span>various techniques, their models and architectures, and their suitability in the IoT applications domain.</span></p>
