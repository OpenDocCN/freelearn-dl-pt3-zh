<p><span>In this section we will learn how to develop a DL solution for the predictive maintenance of IoT using the Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation dataset.</span> <span>Moving on, in this section, we will examine how we can use DL-based IoT solutions in the field of healthcare and discuss two use cases in detail, looking at where healthcare services can be improved and/or automatized using DL-supported IoT solutions. Then, we will look at different challenges faced by existing DL techniques in IoT, especially in resource-constrained and embedded IoT devices, and introduce ourselves to a few future solution directions in order to address the remaining issues.</span></p>
