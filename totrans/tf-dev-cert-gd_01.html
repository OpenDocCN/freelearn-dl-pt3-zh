<h1 id="_idParaDest-16"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"/>Introduction to Machine Learning</h1>
<p>There has never been a more exciting time to be a deep learning expert. With the advent of super-fast computers, open source algorithms, well-curated datasets, and affordable cloud services, deep learning experts are armed with the requisite skills  to build amazing and impactful applications across all domains. Computer vision, natural language processing, and time series analysis are just a few of the areas where deep learning experts can make a real impact. Anyone with the right skills can build a groundbreaking application and perhaps become the next Elon Musk. For this to happen, adequate knowledge of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow <span class="No-Break">is required.</span></p>
<p>The TensorFlow Developer Certificate<a id="_idIndexMarker000"/> aims to build a new generation of deep learning experts who are already in high demand across all fields. Hence, joining this club equips you with the required expertise to start your journey as a deep learning expert and also presents you with a certificate to show for your weeks, months, or years of <span class="No-Break">hard work.</span><a id="_idTextAnchor016"/></p>
<p>We will <a id="_idIndexMarker001"/>begin this chapter with a high-level introduction to <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>), after which we will examine the different types of ML approaches. Next, we will drill down into the ML life cycle and use cases (we will cover a few hands-on implementations in subsequent chapters). We conclude this chapter by introducing the TensorFlow Developer Certificate and examining the anatomy of the core components needed to ace the exam. By the end of this chapter, you should be able to clearly explain what ML is and have gained a foundational understanding of the ML life cycle. Also, after this chapter, you will be able to differentiate between different types of ML approaches and clearly understand what the TensorFlow Developer Certificate exam is <span class="No-Break">all about.</span></p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>What <span class="No-Break">is ML?</span></li>
<li>Types of <span class="No-Break">ML algorithms</span></li>
<li>The ML <span class="No-Break">life cycle</span></li>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>What is ML?</h1>
<p>ML is<a id="_idIndexMarker002"/> a subfield<a id="_idIndexMarker003"/> of <strong class="bold">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>) in which computer systems learn patterns from data to perform specific tasks or make predictions on unseen data without being explicitly programmed. In 1959, Arthur Samuel defined ML as a “<em class="italic">field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed to do so</em>.” To give clarity to the definition given to us by Arthur Samuel, let us unpack it using a well-known use case of ML in the <span class="No-Break">banking industry.</span></p>
<p>Imagine we work in the ML team of a Fortune 500 bank in the heart of London. We are saddled with the responsibility of automating the fraud detection process as the current manual process is too slow and costs the bank millions of pounds sterling, due to delays in the transaction processing time. Based on the preceding definition, we request historical data of previous transactions, containing both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, after which we go through the ML life cycle (which we will cover shortly) and deploy our solution to prevent <span class="No-Break">fraudulent activities.</span></p>
<p>In this example, we used historical data that provides us with the features (independent variables) needed to determine the outcome of the model, which is generally referred to as the target (dependent variable). In this scenario, the target is a fraudulent or non-fraudulent transaction, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.1</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.1 – A flowchart showing the features and the target in our data</p>
<p>In the preceding scenario, we were able to train a model with historical data made up of features and the target to generate rules that are used to make predictions on unseen data. This is an example of what <a id="_idIndexMarker004"/>ML is all about – the ability to empower computers to make decisions without explicit programming. In classic programming, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em>, we feed in the data and some hardcoded rules – for example, the volume of a daily transaction to determine whether it is fraudulent or not. If a customer goes above this daily limit, the customer’s account gets flagged, and a human moderator will intervene to decide whether <a id="_idIndexMarker005"/>the transaction was fraudulent <span class="No-Break">or not.</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer017">
<img alt="Figure 1.2 – A traditional programming approach" height="218" src="image/B18118_01_002.jpg" width="636"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.2 – A traditional programming approach</p>
<p>This approach will soon leave the bank overwhelmed with unhappy customers constantly complaining about delayed transactions, while fraudsters and money launderers will evade the system by simply limiting their transactions within the daily permissible limits defined by the bank. With every new attribute, we would need to update the rules. This approach quickly becomes impractical, as there will always be something new to update to make the system tick. Like a house of cards, the system will eventually fall apart, as such a complex problem with continuously varying attributes across millions of daily transactions may be near impossible to <span class="No-Break">explicitly program.</span></p>
<p>Thankfully, we do not need to hardcode anything. We can use <a id="_idIndexMarker006"/>ML to build a model that can learn to identify patterns of fraudulent transactions from historical data, based on a set of input features in it. We train our model using labeled historical data of past transactions that contain both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. This allows our model to develop rules based on the data, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><em class="italic">.3</em>, which can be applied in the future to detect <span class="No-Break">fraudulent transactions.</span></p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.3 – An ML approach</p>
<p>The rules <a id="_idIndexMarker007"/>generated by examining the data are used by the model to make new predictions to curb fraudulent transactions. This paradigm shift differs from traditional programming where applications are built using well-defined rules. In ML-powered applications, such as our fraud detection system, the model learns to recognize patterns and create rules from the training data; it then uses these rules to make predictions on new data to efficiently flag fraudulent transactions, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.4</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>

<p>In the example we just examined, we can see from <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><em class="italic">.1</em> that our training data is usually structured in a tabular form, made up of numerical values such as transaction amount and frequency of transactions, as well as categorical variables such as location and payment type. In this type of data representation, we can easily identify both the features and the target. However, what about textual data from social media, images from our smartphones, video from streaming movies, and so on, as illustrated in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><em class="italic">.5</em>? How do we approach these types of problems where the data is unstructured? Thankfully, we have a solution, which is<a id="_idIndexMarker008"/> called <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">deep learning</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

<p>Deep learning<a id="_idIndexMarker009"/> is a subset of ML that mimics the human brain by using complex hierarchical models that are composed of multiple processing layers. The buzz around deep learning lies around the state-of-the-art performance recorded by deep learning algorithms over the years across many real-world applications, such as object detection, image classification, and speech recognition, as deep learning algorithms can model complex relationships in data. In <em class="italic">Sections 2</em> and <em class="italic">3</em>, we will discuss deep learning in greater detail and see it in action for image and text applications, respectively. For now, let us probe further into the world of ML by looking at the types of <span class="No-Break">ML algorithms.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>Types of ML algorithms</h1>
<p>In the last section, we looked at what ML is, and we examined a use case where we had labeled data. In this section, we will look at the four main types of ML approaches to give us a base understanding of what each type does, and where and how they can be applied. The four types of<a id="_idIndexMarker010"/> ML algorithms are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="No-Break">Supervised learning</span></li>
<li><span class="No-Break">Unsupervised learning</span></li>
<li><span class="No-Break">Semi-supervised learning</span></li>
<li><span class="No-Break">Reinforcement learning</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s examine the four types of ML methods, which will serve as a building block for <span class="No-Break">later chapters.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>Supervised learning</h2>
<p>In <strong class="bold">supervised learning</strong>, an ML model is trained using data made of features and a target. This enables<a id="_idIndexMarker011"/> the model to learn the underlying relationship in the data. After training, the model can use its newfound knowledge to make predictions on unseen<a id="_idIndexMarker012"/> data. For example, say you want to buy a house. You would consider factors such as the location of the house, the number of rooms, the number of bathrooms, whether it has a garden, and the type of property; these factors you would consider as the features, while the price of the house is the target. Perhaps after the TensorFlow exam, you can roll up your sleeves, scrape some housing data, and train a model to predict house prices based on these features. You can use your house prediction model to compare prices on real estate websites to close a good deal <span class="No-Break">for yourself.</span></p>
<p>There are two types of supervised learning – regression<a id="_idIndexMarker013"/> and classification. In a regression task, the <a id="_idIndexMarker014"/>label is a numeric value, just like the example we gave previously in which the target is the predicted price of the house. Conversely, in a classification task, the label is a category, just like the fraud example we discussed previously, in which the goal was to detect whether a transaction was fraudulent or not fraudulent. In a classification task, the model will learn to categorize the target <span class="No-Break">as classes.</span></p>
<p>When dealing with a <a id="_idIndexMarker015"/>classification task made up of two classes (for example, fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions), it is referred to as binary classification. When there are more than two categories (for example, the classification of different car brands), it is referred to as <span class="No-Break">multi-class classification.</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer021">
<img alt="Figure 1.6: An example of multi-label classification, where the model identifies multiple subjects within an image" height="644" src="image/B18118_01_006.jpg" width="1145"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.6: An example of multi-label classification, where the model identifies multiple subjects within an image</p>
<p>Multi-label classification<a id="_idIndexMarker016"/> is another type of classification, and it is used for image tagging in social media applications such as Facebook and Instagram. Unlike binary and multi-class classification tasks in which we have one target per instance, in multi-label classification our model identifies multiple targets for each instance, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><em class="italic">.6</em>, where our model identifies a girl, a dog, a boy, and a cat in the <span class="No-Break">given photo.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>Unsupervised learning</h2>
<p><strong class="bold">Unsupervised learning</strong> is the <a id="_idIndexMarker017"/>opposite of supervised learning. In this case, there is no <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/>labeled data. The model will have to figure things out by itself. Here, an unsupervised learning algorithm is provided with data, and we expect it to extract meaningful insights from the unlabeled data, by identifying patterns within the data without relying on predefined targets – for example, an image you work on for a large retail store that aims to segment its customers for marketing purposes. You are given data containing the demographics and spending habits of the store’s customers. By employing an unsupervised ML model, you successfully cluster customers with similar characteristics into distinct customer segments. The marketing team can now create a tailored campaign targeted at each of the customer segments identified by the model, potentially leading <a id="_idIndexMarker019"/>to a higher<a id="_idIndexMarker020"/> conversion rate from <span class="No-Break">the campaign.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>Semi-supervised learning</h2>
<p><strong class="bold">Semi-supervised learning</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>combination of supervised and unsupervised learning. In this case, there is some data with labels (i.e., it has both features and a target) and the rest is without labels. In such scenarios, the unlabeled data is <a id="_idIndexMarker022"/>usually the dominant group. In this case, we can apply a combination of unsupervised and supervised learning methods to generate optimal results, especially when the cost implication and time required to manually label the data may not be practical. Here, the model takes advantage of the available label data to learn the underlying relationships, which it then applies to the <span class="No-Break">unlabeled data.</span></p>
<p>Imagine you work for a big corporation that collects a large volume of documents that we need to classify and send to the appropriate department (i.e, finance, marketing, and sales) for effective document management, and only a small number of the documents are labeled. Here, we apply semi-supervised learning, train the model on the labeled document, and apply the learned patterns to classify the remaining <span class="No-Break">unlabeled documents.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>Reinforcement Learning</h2>
<p>In <strong class="bold">reinforcement learning</strong>, unlike<a id="_idIndexMarker023"/> supervised learning, the model does not learn from <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/>training data. Instead, it learns from its interactions within an environment; it gets rewarded for making the right decisions and punished for making wrong choices. It is a trial-and-error learning approach in which the model learns from its past experience to make better decisions in the future. The model aims to maximize reward. Reinforcement learning is applied in self-driving cars, robotics, trading and finance, question answering, and text summarization, among other exciting <span class="No-Break">use cases.</span></p>
<p>Now that we can clearly differentiate between the different types of ML approaches, we can look into what the core components of an ML life cycle are and what steps we should take, from the birth of a project to its application by end users. Let us take a look at the ML <span class="No-Break">life cycle.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>ML life cycle</h1>
<p>Before embarking on any ML project, we must take into account some key components that can determine whether our project will be successful or not. And this is important because as data professionals who want to build and implement successful ML projects, we need to understand how the ML life cycle works. The ML life cycle is a sensible framework to implement an ML<a id="_idIndexMarker025"/> project, as shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.7</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
<div>
<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer022">
<img alt="Figure 1.7 – The ML life cycle" height="573" src="image/B18118_01_007.jpg" width="1149"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.7 – The ML life cycle</p>
<p>Let’s look at each of these <span class="No-Break">in detail.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>The business case</h2>
<p>Before unleashing state-of-the-art<a id="_idIndexMarker026"/> models on any problem, it is imperative you take time to sit with stakeholders to clearly understand the business objectives or the pain points to be resolved, as without clarity, the entire process will almost definitely fail. It is always important to keep in mind that the goal of the entire process is not to test a new breakthrough model you have been itching to try out but to solve a pain point, or create value for <span class="No-Break">your company.</span></p>
<p>Once we understand the problem, we can categorize the problem as either a supervised or unsupervised learning task. This phase of an ML life cycle is all about asking the right questions. We need to sit with the concerned team to determine what the key metrics that would define the project as a success are. What resources are required in terms of budget, manpower, compute, and the project timeline? Do we have the domain understanding or do we need an expert’s input into defining and understanding the underlying factors and goals that will define the project’s success? These are some of the <a id="_idIndexMarker027"/>questions we should ask as data professionals before we embark on <span class="No-Break">a project.</span></p>
<p>For the exam, we will need to understand the requirements of each question before we tackle them. We will discuss a lot more about the exam before we conclude <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Data gathering and understanding</h2>
<p>When all the <a id="_idIndexMarker028"/>requirements are detailed, the next step is to collect the data required for the project. In this phase, we would first determine what type of data we will collect and where we will collect it from. Before we embark on anything, we need to ask ourselves whether the data is relevant – for example, if we collect historical car data from 1980, would we be able to predict the price of a car in 2022? Would data be made available by stakeholders, or would we be collecting it from a<a id="_idIndexMarker029"/> database, <strong class="bold">Internet of Things</strong> (<strong class="bold">IoT</strong>) devices, or via web scraping? Would there be any need for the collection of secondary data for the task at hand? Also, we would need to establish whether the data will be collected all at once or whether it will be a continuous process of data collection. Once we have collected the data needed for the project, we would then examine the data to get an understanding <span class="No-Break">of it.</span></p>
<p>Next, we would examine the data to see whether the data collected is in the right format. For example, if you collect car sales data from multiple sources, one source may calculate a car’s mileage in kilometers per hour and another source could use miles per hour. Also, there could be missing values in some of the features, and we might also encounter duplicates, outliers, and irrelevant features in the data we collected. During this phase, we would carry out data exploration to gain insights into the data, and data preprocessing to handle various issues such as formatting problems, missing values, duplicates, removal of irrelevant features, and handling outliers, imbalanced data, and <span class="No-Break">categorical features.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>Modeling</h2>
<p>Now<a id="_idIndexMarker030"/> that we have a good understanding of the business needs, we have decided on the type of ML problem that we will address, and we also have good-quality data after completing our preprocessing step. We will split our data into a training split and keep a small subset of the test to evaluate the model’s performance. We will train our model to understand the relationship between the features and the target variable using our training set. For example, we could train our fraud detection model on historical data provided by the bank and test it out with our hold out (test set) to evaluate our model’s performance before deploying it for use. We go through an iterative process of fine-tuning our model hyperparameters until we arrive at our <span class="No-Break">optimal model.</span></p>
<p>Defining whether the modeling process is a success or not is tied to the business objective, since achieving a high accuracy of 90 percent would still leave room for a 10 percent error, which could be decisive in high-stake domains such as healthcare. Imagine you deploy a model for early-stage cancer detection with an accuracy of 90 percent, which means the model would likely fail once for every 10 people; in 100 tries, it could fail about 10 times, and it could misclassify someone with cancer as healthy. This could lead to the individual not only failing to seek medical advice but also to an untimely demise. Your company could get sued and the blame would fall in your lap. To avoid situations like this, we need to understand what metrics are important for our project and what we should be less strict with. It is also important to address factors such as class imbalance, model interpretability, and <span class="No-Break">ethical implications.</span></p>
<p>There are various metrics that are used to evaluate a model, and the type of evaluation depends on the type of problem we will handle. We will discuss regression metrics in <a href="B18118_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor065"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Linear Regression with TensorFlow,</em> and classification metrics in <a href="B18118_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></span></a><em class="italic">, Classification </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">with TensorFlow,</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>Error analysis</h2>
<p>We <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>are not ready for deployment yet. Remember the 10 percent data that could tank our project? We will address that here. We perform an error analysis to identify the misclassified labels to identify why the model missed them. Do we have enough representative samples of these misclassified labels in our training data? We would have to determine whether we need to collect more data to capture these cases where the model failed. Can we generate synthetic data to capture the misclassified labels? Or was the misclassified data down to the <span class="No-Break">wrong labeling?</span></p>
<p>Wrongly <a id="_idIndexMarker032"/>labeled data can hamper the performance of a model, as it will learn incorrect relationships between the features and target, resulting in poor performance on unseen data, making the model unreliable and the entire process a waste of resources and time. Once we resolve these questions and ensure accurate labels, we need to retrain and reevaluate our model. These steps are continuous until the business objective is achieved, and then we can proceed to deploy <span class="No-Break">our model.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>Model deployment and monitoring</h2>
<p>After<a id="_idIndexMarker033"/> resolving the issues identified in the error analysis step, we can now deploy our model to production. There are various methods of deployment available. We could deploy our model as a web service, on the cloud, or on edge devices. Model deployment can be challenging as well as exciting because the entire point of building and training a model is to allow end users to apply it to solve a pain point. Once we deploy our model, we also monitor the model to ensure that the overall objectives of the business are continually achieved, and even the best-performing models can begin to underperform over time due to concept drift and data drift. Hence, after deploying our model, we cannot retire to some island. We need to continuously monitor our model and retrain the model when needed in order to ensure it continues to <span class="No-Break">perform optimally.</span></p>
<p>We have now gone through the full length of the ML life cycle at a high level. Of course, there is a lot more that we can talk about in greater depth, but this is out of the scope of this exam. Hence, we will now switch our focus to looking at a number of exciting use cases where ML can <span class="No-Break">be applied.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>Exploring ML use cases</h1>
<p>Beyond the car price <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>prediction and fraud detection use cases, let’s look at some exciting applications of ML here. Perhaps it will get you fired up for both the exams and inspire you to build something spectacular in your <span class="No-Break">ML journey.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>Healthcare</h2>
<p>HearAngel uses AI to <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>automatically prevent hearing loss for headphone users by tracking users’ exposure to unhealthy levels of sounds from the headphones. Insitro uses knowledge of ML and biology for drug discovery and development. Other use cases of ML in healthcare include smart record keeping, data collection, disease outbreak forecasting, personalized medicine, and <span class="No-Break">disease identification.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>The retail industry</h2>
<p>ML engineers are revolutionizing<a id="_idIndexMarker036"/> the retail industry by deploying models to enhance customer experience and improve profitability. This is achieved by optimizing assortment planning, predicting customer behavior, the provision of virtual assistants, inventory optimization, tracking customers’ sentiments, price optimization, product recommendation, and customer segmentation, among other use cases. In the retail industry, ML engineers provide value by automating cumbersome <span class="No-Break">manual processes.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>The entertainment industry</h2>
<p>The entertainment industry<a id="_idIndexMarker037"/> currently applies ML/AI in automatic script and lyric generation. Yes, currently there are movie script-writing ML models. One such movie is a short science fiction movie called <em class="italic">Sunspring</em> (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/an-ai-wrote-this-movie-and-its-strangely-moving/">https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/an-ai-wrote-this-movie-and-its-strangely-moving/</a>). Also, ML/AI is used for automatic caption generation, augmented reality, game development, target marketing, sentiment analysis, movie recommendation, and sales forecasting, among others. So, if you plan to carve a niche in this industry as an ML engineer, there is a lot you can do, and surely you can also come up with some <span class="No-Break">new ideas.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Education</h2>
<p>Readrly utilizes deep learning<a id="_idIndexMarker038"/> techniques to create personalized children’s stories, enhancing the learning experience for young readers. By tailoring stories to each child’s interests and skill level, Readrly supports children’s reading development in a fun and <span class="No-Break">engaging way.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Agriculture</h2>
<p>There are numerous use cases <a id="_idIndexMarker039"/>of ML in agriculture. ML/AI can be used for price forecasting, disease detection, weather prediction, yield mapping, soil and crop health monitoring, and precision farming, <span class="No-Break">among others.</span></p>
<p>Here, we covered some use cases of ML. However, the exciting part is that, as an ML/DL engineer, you will be able to apply your knowledge to any industry as long as data is available. And that is the awesomeness of being an ML engineer – there are no restrictions. We have covered a lot already in this chapter; however, we have one more section to go, and it is a very important one, as it centers on the exam itself. Let’s <span class="No-Break">jump in.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>Introducing the learning journey</h1>
<p>The TensorFlow Developer Certificate exam<a id="_idIndexMarker040"/> was designed and developed by Google to assess data professionals’ expertise in model building and training deep learning models with TensorFlow.

<p>We have now covered what and why. Now, let us look at how you can ace <span class="No-Break">the exam.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>How to ace the exam</h2>
<p>If you’re looking to become a certified TensorFlow developer, there are a few things you should know. First, you should be proficient in Python. Second, you’ll need to have a strong understanding of ML concepts and be able to use TensorFlow to build and train deep learning models with TensorFlow. If you’re not already familiar with Python programming, then <em class="italic">Modern Python Cookbook – Second Edition</em> by Steven F Lott is a good place <span class="No-Break">to start.</span></p>
<p>Here are some<a id="_idIndexMarker045"/> tips to help you ace the TensorFlow Developer <span class="No-Break">Certificate exam:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Review the course material</strong>: Before taking the exam, be sure to review the materials for every topic in the TensorFlow candidate handbook in detail. Pay special attention to building and training models, since the exam <span class="No-Break">is hands-on.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Model building</strong>: In addition to reviewing the course material, it’s also important to get some hands-on experience with TensorFlow. Experiment with building models, covering each section of the exam requirement. This book will get you started with the core fundamentals of ML and walk you through each section of the exam in a hands-on manner, ensuring that you can comfortably build and train all sorts of models with TensorFlow – from simple linear models to complex <span class="No-Break">neural networks.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Understand the exam format</strong>: The exam is unlike many other exams. It is a five-hour coding exam with questions covering each section of the exam that we outlined. You will be given a task and asked to write code to solve it in PyCharm. So, you will need to spend some time mastering how to build, train, and save models in PyCharm before the exams. The exam is an open-book one, so you are allowed to use any resource you want during <span class="No-Break">the exam.</span></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Practice, practice, practice</strong>: One of the best ways to prepare for the exam is to practice solving questions. You will find lots of hands-on practice questions in every chapter of this book, along with code files in the book’s GitHub repository. Additionally, you <a id="_idIndexMarker046"/>will find lots of datasets on the TensorFlow website <span class="No-Break">and Kaggle.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve completed this book, you should be ready to take the TensorFlow Developer <span class="No-Break">Certificate exam.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>When to take the exam</h2>
<p>Depending on <a id="_idIndexMarker047"/>your experience, you may need more or less time to prepare for the exam. If you are familiar with TensorFlow already, with hands-on model-building skills, you may take between three weeks to two months to prepare for the exam. However, if you are completely new to TensorFlow, it is advisable to look at around six months to thoroughly prepare for this exam, as stipulated on the exam website. However, these rules are not cast in stone. Everyone is different, so go at your <span class="No-Break">own pace.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>Exam tips</h2>
<p>After you sign up<a id="_idIndexMarker048"/> for the exam, you can take it within a six-month period. It is okay to set a target day for your exams early enough. The exam takes place in PyCharm, so you will need to take a few days or weeks to get used to PyCharm (if you’re not familiar with it) before the exam day. Here is an excellent video tutorial by Jeff Henton to help you set up your PyCharm environment: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRY5lx-So-c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRY5lx-So-c</a>. Ensure you install the stipulated version of PyCharm. You can also learn more about setting up the exam environment using this <span class="No-Break">link: </span><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/static/extras/cert/Setting_Up_TF_Developer_Certificate_Exam.pdf"><span class="No-Break">https://www.tensorflow.org/static/extras/cert/Setting_Up_TF_Developer_Certificate_Exam.pdf</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<p>Before the exam, it helps to have a clearly planned study routine in which you can cover the outlined syllabus for the exam. This book will help you on this journey, so you should pay attention to the next chapters, as we will start coding and tackling the core components, which make up the exam henceforth. On exam day, I would advise you to find a quiet, comfortable space to take this exam. Ensure you are well rested and not going in exhausted, as the exam is five hours long. Also, try out your PyCharm and internet connectivity. Don’t panic, and read the questions thoroughly to have a clear understanding of what is required of you. Start from questions 1 to 5. Since the questions get more difficult, it is better to get the easy ones out of the way quickly and tackle the more difficult <span class="No-Break">ones afterward.</span></p>
<p>However, you should pace yourself correctly. Your saved model will be graded each time you submit it, and you are allowed to submit as many times as you want within the stipulated 5-hour time frame until you achieve an optimal result. You can also run your model in Colab if this enables you to work faster, especially if you have a model running in PyCharm. Colab provides you with free GPU access to train your model. The exam will be graded only in PyCharm, so bear this in mind. Ensure you save the model you train in Colab, and move it to the directory where you are stipulated to save the model for <span class="No-Break">the exam.</span></p>
<p>If you need <a id="_idIndexMarker049"/>help, you can use Stack Overflow. You can also look through the code we use in this book, or any other material you use to prepare for your exam. However, if a question proves too difficult, move on to other questions. When you are done, you can return to the difficult one and work your way through it to avoid losing all your time on a difficult question. Also, you are allowed to submit multiple times, so work on improving your models until you attain <span class="No-Break">optimal performance.</span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>What to expect after the exam</h2>
<p>The exam<a id="_idIndexMarker050"/> ends after five hours exactly, but you can submit it before that. After which, you will receive a congratulatory email if you have passed. After passing this exam, you will now be a member of the Google TensorFlow Developer community, opening more doors of opportunity for yourself. Assuming you pass (and I hope you do), you will get your certificate in about a week, which will look like <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 1</em></span><em class="italic">.10</em>, and you will be added to the Google TensorFlow community in about two weeks. The certificate is valid for a period of <span class="No-Break">three years.</span></p>
