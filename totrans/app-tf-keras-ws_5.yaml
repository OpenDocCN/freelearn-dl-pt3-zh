- en: The accuracy graph measures how accurately the network was able to guess the
    labels of a test set. At first, the network guesses those labels completely incorrectly.
    This happens because we have initialized the weights and biases of our network
    with random values, so its first attempts are a guess. The network will then change
    the weights and biases of its layers on a second run; the network will continue
    to invest in the nodes that give positive results by altering their weights and
    biases and will penalize those that don't by gradually reducing their impact on
    the network (eventually reaching `0`). As you can see, this is an efficient technique
    that quickly yields great results.
