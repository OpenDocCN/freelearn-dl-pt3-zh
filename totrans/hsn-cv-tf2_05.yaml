- en: In this section, you will discover and apply modern methods to solve a variety
    of problems. Classification, a canonical machine learning task, will serve as
    a great example to introduce up-to-date neural network architectures (such as
    **Inception** and **ResNet**) and transfer learning. Object detection, useful
    for self-driving cars and other robots, will serve to illustrate the trade-off
    between speed and accuracy through the comparison of two widely used algorithms—**YOLO**
    and **Faster R-CNN**. Finally, building upon the two previous chapters, the final
    chapter in this section ends with an in-depth presentation of encoder-decoder
    networks applied to image denoising and semantic segmentation.
