    to understand the scale of its applicability and the return of investment that
    it can promise. This chapter illustrates some of the most famous websites whose
    product was based heavily upon leveraging the power of deep learning. This chapter
    also discusses some key research areas in web development that can be enhanced
    using deep learning. This chapter will help you to delve even deeper into the
    fusion of web technologies and deep learning and will motivate you to come up
    with your own intelligent web applications.

    AI at their core to boost their business growth. It's worth noting here that it
    is not important that your entire product or service is based on any AI technique
    or algorithm; only having AI in a small portion of it or for a specific feature
    is enough to boost your product's usefulness and hence the widespread usage of
    your product by customers. Sometimes, you may not even have AI present in any
    of the product's features, and instead, you might only use it to perform data
    analysis and come up with expected trends to make sure your product conforms to
    the upcoming trends. Let's take a look at what worked for these companies as they
    made it large.

    forums. At one point in time in the history of the internet, online forums were
    seen as something that could no longer be improved; however, Quora came up with
    a few tweaks that were enabled using deep learning to help them rapidly outperform
    other forums. The following are the tweaks that they implemented:'

    was published using the Ask to Answer feature. This made it easier for the questions
    to reach the relevant subject experts, who gave answers rapidly and made the platform
    more responsive and accurate.

- en: Learning a new language has always been a tough feat. When Duolingo came onto
    the market in 2012, it brought with it a term that was beginning to grow in importance
    and scope—artificial intelligence. They converted something as mundane as memorizing
    words and grammar rules into minigames that would respond differently to each
    user. The Duolingo AI took into account the temporal nature of the human mind.
    They formulated research on how quickly a person is likely to forget the words
    he/she has learned. They called this concept half-life regression and used it
    to reinforce the knowledge of the words it predicted that the user would have
    forgotten at any given point of time.

    brought to the table. Spotify used deep learning to determine which songs a user
    would like to hear at any given point of time. Over the years, their AI has progressed
    in leaps and bounds, suggesting entire playlists according to the recently played
    songs of the user. The rapid rise of Spotify has inspired a huge number of products
    that attempt to do the same and are trying to catch up with the popularity of
    Spotify.

    an audio sample. It was an instant hit feature; many users downloaded Spotify
    just because they could not remember the name of a nice song they were listening
    to wanted to find its name out quickly. You simply had to record the audio of
    a song playing nearby and feed it to Spotify to know the song that was playing.

    the system first needs to process the signal, which is known as audio signal processing.
    The system then compares that processed signal with its existing database of tens
    of thousands of songs. Before the signal is even compared to an existing database,
    it is given a particular representation using a neural network, which is often
    referred to as a fingerprint; however, this is still an active area of research,
    and I highly encourage you to read the article at  [https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/09/googles-next-generation-music.html](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/09/googles-next-generation-music.html) for

    Social media has easily become one of the prime sources of news for us; however,
    its authenticity is often not ensured. Not every news article that you stumble
    across on social media is genuine, and it is safe to say that a vast number of
    them are fake. The after-effects of this phenomenon can be really very alarming,
    and it can indeed lead to acts of abuse, violence, and so on.
