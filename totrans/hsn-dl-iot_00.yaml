- en: In the **Internet of Things** (**IoT**) era, a huge large number of sensing
    devices collect and generate various sensory data over time for a wide range of
    applications. This data is predominantly made up of big, fast, and real-time streams
    based on the applications. The use of analytics in relation to such big data or
    data streams is crucial for learning new information, predicting future insights,
    and making informed decisions, which makes IoT a worthy paradigm for businesses
    and a quality-of-life improving technology.

    learning techniques called **deep learning** (**DL**), to facilitate the analytics
    and learning in various IoT applications. A hands-on overview will take you through
    what each process is, from data collection, analysis, modeling, and a model's
    performance evaluation, to various IoT application and deployment settings.

    applications for image-based road faults detection and smart garbage separation,
    followed by implementing voice-initiated smart light control and home access mechanisms
    powered by **recurrent neural networks** (**RNN**).

    and locating equipment in a large hospital using autoencoders, DeepFi, and LSTM
    networks. Furthermore, you'll learn IoT application development for healthcare
    with IoT security enhanced. After reading this book, you will have a good head
    start at developing more complex DL applications for IoT-enabled devices.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is intended for anyone who wants to use DL techniques to analyze and
    understand IoT generated big and real-time data streams with the power of TensorFlow,
    Keras, and Chainer. If you want to build your own extensive IoT applications that
    work, and that can predict smart decisions in the future, then this book is what
    you need! Hence, this book is dedicated to IoT application developers, data analysts,
    or DL enthusiasts who do not have much background in complex numerical computations,
    but who want to know what DL actually is.

    of IoT*, discusses the end-to-end life cycle of IoT and its related concepts and
    components, as well as the key characteristics and issues of IoT data that demands
    the use of DL in IoT. Furthermore, it also covers the importance of analytics
    in the IoT and the motivation to use DL in data analytics.'

    for IoT*, provides the basic concepts of DL architectures and platforms, which
    will be used in all subsequent chapters. We will start with a brief introduction
    to machine learning (ML) and move to DL, which is a branch of ML based on a set
    of algorithms that attempt to model high-level abstractions in data. We will briefly
    discuss some of the most well-known and widely used neural network architectures.
    Finally, various features of DL frameworks and libraries will be discussed, which
    will be used for developing DL applications on IoT-enabled devices.'

    decision making. This chapter also briefly discusses two IoT applications and
    their image detection-based implementation in a real-world scenario. In the second
    part of the chapter, we shall present a hands-on image detection implementation
