<p class="mce-root"><span>This book is a collection of newly evolved deep learning models, methodologies, and implementations based on the areas of their application. </span><span>In the first section of the book, you will learn about the building blocks of deep learning and the math behind <strong>neural networks</strong> (<strong>NNs</strong>). </span><span>In the second section, you'll focus on <strong>convolutional neural networks</strong> (<strong>CNNs</strong>) and their advanced applications in <strong>computer vision</strong> (<strong>CV</strong>). You'll learn to apply the most popular CNN architectures in object detection and image segmentation. Finally, you'll discuss variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span>In the third section, you'll focus on natural language and sequence processing. You'll use NNs to extract sophisticated vector representations of words. You'll discuss various types of recurrent networks, such as <strong>long short-term memory</strong> (<strong>LSTM</strong>) and <strong>gated recurrent unit</strong> (GRU). Finally, you'll cover the attention mechanism to process sequential data without the help of recurrent networks. </span><span>In the final section, you'll learn how to use graph NNs to process structured data. You'll cover meta-learning, which allows you to train an NN with fewer training samples. And finally, you'll learn how to apply deep learning in autonomous vehicles.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span>By the end of this book, you'll have gained mastery of the key concepts associated with deep learning and evolutionary approaches to monitoring and managing deep learning models.</span></p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>Build the full GAN model by including the </span><kbd>generator</kbd><span>, </span><kbd>discriminator</kbd><span>, and the</span><span> <kbd>combined</kbd></span><span> </span><span>network</span>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre><span>import </span>matplotlib.pyplot <span>as </span>plt<br/><span>from </span>matplotlib.markers <span>import </span>MarkerStyle<br/><span>import </span>numpy <span>as </span>np<br/><span>import </span>tensorflow <span>as </span>tf<br/><span>from </span>tensorflow.keras <span>import </span>backend <span>as </span>K<br/><span>from </span>tensorflow.keras.layers <span>import </span>Lambda<span>, </span>Input<span>, </span>Dense</pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "The collection of all possible outcomes (events) of an experiment is called, <strong>sample</strong> <strong>space</strong></span>.<span>"</span></p>
