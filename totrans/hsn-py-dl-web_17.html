<p>In this section, we will take a brief look at some products/companies that used AI at their core to boost their business growth. It's worth noting here that it is not important that your entire product or service is based on any AI technique or algorithm; only having AI in a small portion of it or for a specific feature is enough to boost your product's usefulness and hence the widespread usage of your product by customers. Sometimes, you may not even have AI present in any of the product's features, and instead, you might only use it to perform data analysis and come up with expected trends to make sure your product conforms to the upcoming trends. Let's take a look at what worked for these companies as they made it large.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Before Quora, there had been a plethora of question-and-answer websites and forums. At one point in time in the history of the internet, online forums were seen as something that could no longer be improved; however, Quora came up with a few tweaks that were enabled using deep learning to help them rapidly outperform other forums. The following are the tweaks that they implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>They enabled contributors to request an answer to any question as soon as it was published using the Ask to Answer feature. This made it easier for the questions to reach the relevant subject experts, who gave answers rapidly and made the platform more responsive and accurate.</li>
<li>They blocked out poorly written questions and answers using <strong>natural language processing</strong> (<strong>NLP</strong>). This brought in the concept of automoderated forums with high-quality content. </li>
<li>The determination of tags and related articles for any given question–answer thread made the discovery of similar questions easy. This made Quora users spend a lot of time reading answers to similar questions to theirs just to find new information in each of them.  </li>
<li>The Quora Digest newsletter was a highly curated collection of articles, based on the user's interests, that almost always succeeded in bringing the user back to the platform:</li>

<p>Quora at one point in time became (and is still counted among) the most addictive social platforms on the internet. They took a simple question-and-answer website and used deep learning to transform it into an amazing platform.

<p>Learning a new language has always been a tough feat. When Duolingo came onto the market in 2012, it brought with it a term that was beginning to grow in importance and scope—artificial intelligence. They converted something as mundane as memorizing words and grammar rules into minigames that would respond differently to each user. The Duolingo AI took into account the temporal nature of the human mind. They formulated research on how quickly a person is likely to forget the words he/she has learned. They called this concept half-life regression and used it to reinforce the knowledge of the words it predicted that the user would have forgotten at any given point of time. </p>
<p>This worked immensely in their favor and made Duolingo one of the most popular apps on mobile app stores. Their website is also a classic example of unorthodox designs that were well received. You can learn more about Duolingo at <a href="https://duolingo.com">https://duolingo.com</a>.</p>

<p>Audio players have existed for a very long time, but no one had what Spotify brought to the table. Spotify used deep learning to determine which songs a user would like to hear at any given point of time. Over the years, their AI has progressed in leaps and bounds, suggesting entire playlists according to the recently played songs of the user. The rapid rise of Spotify has inspired a huge number of products that attempt to do the same and are trying to catch up with the popularity of Spotify.</p>
<p>Spotify also introduced a very powerful feature—searching for a song based on an audio sample. It was an instant hit feature; many users downloaded Spotify just because they could not remember the name of a nice song they were listening to wanted to find its name out quickly. You simply had to record the audio of a song <span>playing</span><span> </span><span>nearby and feed it to Spotify to know the song that was playing.</span></p>

<p>While image storage on the cloud was an existing solution offered by companies such as Dropbox, Google Photos revolutionized the cloud image storage space by bringing AI into the equation. Google Photos has been adopted by billions of people worldwide because of its amazing features, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Face recognition:</strong> This feature was present in an earlier Google product named Picasa, which is considered to be the precursor to Google Photos.</li>
<li><strong>Wizard:</strong> Google Photos automatically determines which photos were taken at the same event or occasion. It then tries to create movies about the related pictures or simply touches upon the images to make them appear better. Sometimes, Google Photos also creates animated GIFs with photos that appear to be in a sequence.</li>
<li><strong>Recognition of documents and memes:</strong> Google Photos suggests that its users archive old documents, screenshots, and memes. This is very helpful in saving device storage:</li>
</ul>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Audio search</h1>
                </header>

<p>Suppose you are in a pub and you like the song being played by the live band. In your mind, you know that you have already heard that song before, but you are unable to recollect the name of the song. Wouldn't it be nice if you could have a system that would listen to the song and search for its name? Welcome to the world of audio search engines! </p>
<p>There are a number of existing audio search engines available out there, with Sound Search (which is offered by Google Assistant) being one of the most popular ones. You might <span>also</span><span> </span><span>want to check out Shazam. In the following screenshot, you can see a sample audio search result produced via Sound Search:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1240 image-border" src="assets/9960ba72-9308-4507-bc6f-33b4ea110623.png" style="width:21.33em;height:39.50em;"/></p>
<p>For a system to perform an audio search based on the audio signal it is receiving, the system first needs to process the signal, which is known as audio signal processing. The system then compares that processed signal with its existing database of tens of thousands of songs. Before the signal is even compared to an existing database, it is given a particular representation using a neural network, which is often referred to as a fingerprint; however, this is still an active area of research, and I highly encourage you to read the article at <span> </span><a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/09/googles-next-generation-music.html">https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/09/googles-next-generation-music.html</a> <span>for a more detailed overview of these techniques</span><span>. </span></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Reading comprehension</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Have you ever wished that a search engine would give you the answer to your search query instead of finding suitable links to resources that might contain the answer to your search query? Well, it's <span>now</span><span> </span><span>possible for a system to achieve this if it is programmed with reading comprehension. Let's look at the following screenshot to see what this means:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1241 image-border" src="assets/481443bd-131c-438b-94ce-0efe89d8eedd.png" style="width:43.33em;height:27.00em;"/></p>
<p>If you notice carefully, we did not even phrase the statement <em>Sachin Tendulkar's father</em> as a question. Modern systems are capable enough to infer properties like this by themselves.</p>
<p>Now, to be able to appreciate the depth of a system (or a machine) that has reading comprehension, say that you wanted to find an answer to your question after performing a web search. This is the multistep process that you would need to go through:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400">You start by formulating the search query with the relevant keywords and the search engine performs the search. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">The search engine then gives you a list of relevant documents for the given search query. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">You go through those documents, organize the information present in them according to your understanding, and then you come to a conclusion. </li>
</ol>
<p>There are still a number of steps that are manual in nature, and the question still gets raised—can we design a system that would automate the process of finding that suitable answer for us? Existing search engines give us a list of relevant documents for given search queries, but are not sufficient to develop systems that can actually produce answers to the search queries by themselves. Briefly, such a system would need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Follow the structure of the relevant documents.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Make sense out of the contents present in those documents.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Come to a final answer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's simplify the problem a bit. Let's say that for a given question, we already have a list of relevant passages and now we need to develop a system that would actually make sense out of those passages and give us a definite answer for the given question. In reading comprehension systems, neural networks typically learn to capture a deep semantic relationship between the given questions and the relevant passages and then they formulate the final answers. </p>
<p>As you might have already figured out, search engines such as Google Search, Bing, and so on already come with the capability of reading comprehension. </p>

<p>With social media booming at a very rapid pace, there is never a dearth of news. Social media has easily become one of the prime sources of news for us; however, its authenticity is often not ensured. Not every news article that you stumble across on social media is genuine, and it is safe to say that a vast number of them are fake. The after-effects of this phenomenon can be really very alarming, and it can indeed lead to acts of abuse, violence, and so on. </p>
<p>There are a handful of organizations and agencies that are trying to fight with this and make people aware of the authenticity of news articles. This task can be very tedious given the amount of news that we see daily on social media. So, the question now becomes can we leverage the power of machine learning to automatically detect fake news? This is, in fact, an active area of research and there are no substantial applications that are known to tackle this at a large scale. </p>
<p>However, the following are some research studies conducted by various groups where they have used classical machine learning and deep learning approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><em>Detecting Fake News in Social Media Networks</em>: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050918318210">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050918318210</a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><em>Fake News Detection on Social Media using Geometric Deep Learning</em>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06673">https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06673</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You are encouraged to check out the survey paper at <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00315.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00315.pdf</a>, which provides a comprehensive guide on various fake news detection techniques and also discusses related research on the subject. On the other hand, a German startup named Varia (<a href="https://www.varia.media/">https://www.varia.media/</a>) is trying to solve the problem of fake news in a unique way. Instead of detecting the authenticity of the news, they are providing different perspectives of certain news items. In other words, they are providing perspective as a service.

<p>In this final chapter of this book, we have tried to inspire you to build your next deep learning project and use it on a web platform. You might be interested in the stories of more such companies that transformed their businesses using AI and ruled the market space. If you take a look at almost every website you visit, they will all use elements of AI and deep learning on them in some way, be it in the form of recommendation systems or advertisements (which are again promotional recommendation systems). We then covered the upcoming topics in the field of deep learning, which are looking for implementation on websites in the very near future. It would be amazing if you could come up with a service based on any of these topics!</p>
