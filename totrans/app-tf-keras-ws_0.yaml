- en: Machine learning gives computers the ability to learn like humans. It is becoming
    increasingly transformational to businesses in many forms, and a key skill to
    learn to prepare for the future digital economy.

- en: As a beginner, you'll unlock a world of opportunities by learning the techniques
    you need to contribute to the domains of machine learning, deep learning, and
    modern data analysis using the latest cutting-edge tools.

- en: '*The Applied TensorFlow and Keras Workshop* begins by showing you how neural
    networks work. After you''ve understood the basics, you will train a few networks
    by altering their hyperparameters. To build on your skills, you''ll learn how
    to select the most appropriate model to solve the problem in hand. While tackling
    advanced concepts, you''ll discover how to assemble a deep learning system by
    bringing together all the essential elements necessary for building a basic deep
    learning system - data, model, and prediction. Finally, you''ll explore ways to
    evaluate the performance of your model, and improve it using techniques such as
    model evaluation and hyperparameter optimization.'

    who is looking to design, train, and deploy TensorFlow and Keras models into real-world
    applications, then this workshop is for you. Knowledge of computer science and
    machine learning concepts and experience in analyzing data will help you to understand
    the topics explained in this book with ease.

- en: '*Chapter 1*, *Introduction to Neural Networks and Deep Learning*, gets us to
    select a TensorFlow-trained neural network using TensorBoard and trains the neural
    network by varying epochs and learning rates. This will give you hands-on experience
    of how to train a highly performant neural network and allow you to explore some
    of its limitations.'

    us how to assemble a complete deep learning system, from data input to prediction.
    The model created will serve as a benchmark from which we will be able to make
    improvements.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 3*, *Real-World Deep Learning: Evaluating the Bitcoin Model*, focuses
    on how to evaluate a neural network model. Using hyperparameter tuning, we will
    improve the performance of the network. However, before altering any parameters,
    we need to measure how the model performs. By the end of this chapter, you will
    be able to evaluate a model using different functions and techniques.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 4,* *Productization*, covers the handling of new data. We will create
    a model that is able to learn continuously from the patterns it''s shown and make
    better predictions. We will use a web application as an example to demonstrate
    how to deploy deep learning models.'
