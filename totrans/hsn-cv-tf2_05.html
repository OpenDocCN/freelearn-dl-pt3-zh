<p class="mce-root"><span>In this section, you will discover and apply modern methods to solve a variety of problems. Classification, a canonical machine learning task, will serve as a great example to introduce up-to-date neural network architectures (such as <strong>Inception</strong> and <strong>ResNet</strong>) and transfer learning. Object detection, useful for self-driving cars and other robots, will serve to illustrate the trade-off between speed and accuracy through the comparison of two widely used algorithms—<strong>YOLO</strong> and <strong>Faster R-CNN</strong>. Finally, building upon the two previous chapters, the final chapter in this section ends with an in-depth presentation of encoder-decoder networks applied to image denoising and semantic segmentation.</span></p>
