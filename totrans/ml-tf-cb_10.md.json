Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.\nThis is the first time a herd of unicorns have been discovered in the Andes Mountains, a vast region stretching from the Himalayas to the Andes River in Bolivia.\nAccording to the BBC, the unicorns were spotted by a small group of researchers on a private expedition, but they were the only ones that came across the bizarre creatures.\nIt was later learned that these were not the wild unicorns that were spotted in the wild in recent years, but rather a domesticated variety of the species.\nAlthough they do not speak English, they do carry their own unique language, according to the researchers, who have named it \"Ungla.\"\nThe herd of unicorns, which was discovered by a small group of researchers, is the first of its kind discovered in the Andes Mountains. It is thought that the herd of wild unicorns were introduced to the area hundreds of years ago by a local rancher who was attempting to make a profit from the animals.\nAlthough they do not speak English, they do carry their own unique language, according to the researchers, who have named it \"Ungla.\"\nThe researchers claim that the unicorns have only been sighted in the Andes Mountains, where they can be seen throughout the mountains of South America.\nWhile the unicorns do not speak English, they do carry their own unique language, according to the researchers, who have named it \"Ungla.\"\nUngla is a highly intelligent, cooperative species with a high level of social and cognitive complexity, and is capable of displaying sophisticated behaviors.\nThey are a particularly unique species, because they are capable of surviving in extreme conditions for long periods of time and without being fed or watered.\nThe team believes that the species was probably domesticated in the Andes Mountains, where it could not survive in its natural habitat.\n\"We can see from the genetics that the animals were probably domesticated in the Andes Mountains where they could not survive in their natural habitat and with water and food sources,\" said Professor David Catt, from the University of Cambridge, who led the study.\n\"So these were animals that would have been... \n```", "```\nprompt2 = 'Miley Cyrus was caught shoplifting from Abercrombie and Fitch on Hollywood Boulevard today.'\ninput_ids = tokenizer.encode(prompt2, return_tensors='tf')\nsample_outputs = GPT2.generate(\n                              input_ids,\n                              do_sample = True, \n                              max_length = MAX_LEN,                              #to test how long we can generate and it be coherent\n                              #temperature = .8,\n                              top_k = 50, \n                              top_p = 0.85\n                              #num_return_sequences = 5\n)\nprint(\"Output:\\n\" + 100 * '-')\nfor i, sample_output in enumerate(sample_outputs):\n    print(\"{}: {}...\".format(i, tokenizer.decode(sample_output, skip_    special_tokens = True)))\n    print('')\nOutput:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0: Miley Cyrus was caught shoplifting from Abercrombie and Fitch on Hollywood Boulevard today. In a video captured by one of her friends, the singer is seen grabbing her bag, but then quickly realizing the merchandise she has to leave is too expensive to be worth a $1.99 purchase.\nThe video has already gone viral, and while the celebrity is certainly guilty of breaking the law (even if she can't be accused of stealing for a second time), there's one aspect of the situation that should make the most sense. It's just like the shopping situation in the movie The Fast and the Furious, where Michael Corleone is caught in possession of counterfeit designer clothing.\nThis time around, though, the situation involves Cyrus. It's not a copy, per se. It's actually a replica, a pair of a black and white Nike Air Force 1s, a colorway she wore in her music video.\nIt seems that the actress is caught by a friend who had gotten her a pair of those sneakers when she was in school, so this is no surprise to her. After all, there was a video of her stealing from her own store back in 2012, when she was a freshman at New York University.\nIt's not that there's anything wrong with the product. If the merchandise is in good shape, that's all that matters. But there are a few things that should come to mind when it comes to these shoes.\nFor one, the fabric is incredibly thin. The fabric is so thin that the upper actually makes the shoes look like they're made of leather. There's even a thin layer of plastic between the upper and the shoe.\nSecondly, the material isn't even a shoe. It's just a piece of leather. It's not actually a leather shoe at all, even though it's made of the same material as the other items on the show. It's just a piece of leather. And it's not the kind of leather that would actually hold up in a fight.\nThis is something that should be familiar to anyone who's ever shopped at the store. If you go into the store looking for a pair of new Nike Air Force 1s, and the salesperson is just selling you a piece of leather, you're going to get disappointed. That's the nature of these shoes.\nIn addition to the aforementioned \"stolen\" footwear, Miley Cyrus... \n```", "```\nprompt3 = 'Legolas and Gimli advanced on the orcs, raising their weapons with a harrowing war cry'\ninput_ids = tokenizer.encode(prompt3, return_tensors='tf')\nsample_outputs = GPT2.generate(\n                              input_ids,\n                              do_sample = True, \n                              max_length = MAX_LEN,                              #to test how long we can generate and it be coherent\n                              #temperature = .8,\n                              top_k = 50, \n                              top_p = 0.85 \n                              #num_return_sequences = 5\n)\nprint(\"Output:\\n\" + 100 * '-')\nfor i, sample_output in enumerate(sample_outputs):\n    print(\"{}: {}...\".format(i, tokenizer.decode(sample_output, skip_    special_tokens = True)))\n    print('')\nOutput:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0: Legolas and Gimli advanced on the orcs, raising their weapons with a harrowing war cry, and they roared their battle cries as they charged the orcs with their spears and arrows.

The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall. Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $916 million). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor. The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage. It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.\" },\n    { \"question\": \"Who ruled macedonia \", \"context\": \"Macedonia was an ancient kingdom on the periphery of Archaic and Classical Greece, and later the dominant state of Hellenistic Greece.
