    any task that involves sequential data. The core idea behind RNNs is to exploit
    the sequential information present in the data. Under usual circumstances, every
    neural network assumes that all of the inputs are independent of each other. However,
    if we are trying to predict the next word in a sequence or the next point in a
    time series, it is imperative to use information based on the words used prior or
    on the historical points in the time series.'

    information about historical data in a sequence. In theory, RNNs can remember
    history for arbitrarily long sequences, however, in practice, they do a bad job
    in tasks where the historical information needs to be retained for more than a
    few steps back.

- en: Interestingly, the model learns to use a full stop after a sentence, leaves
    a blank line between paragraphs, and follows basic grammar. The model has learned
    all of this by itself, without us having to provide any guidance/rules. Despite
    the fact that the script is far from perfect, it's amazing how a machine is able
    to generate real-sounding sentences of a book. We can further fine-tune the hyperparameters
    of the model to generate more meaningful text.

    known as LSTMs. We learned that RNNs are hugely successful in predicting datasets
    that involve sequences such as time series, next word prediction in natural language
    processing tasks, and so on. We also looked at the advantages and disadvantages
    of using LSTMs.

    it so that we can feed it into LSTMs. We also looked at the model's structure
    for training. Next, we looked at how to train the neural networks by creating
    batches of data.

    we trained. Although the script that was generated doesn't make complete sense,
    it was amazing to observe the neural network generate a book's sentences. We then
    saved the generated book script in a text file for future reference.
