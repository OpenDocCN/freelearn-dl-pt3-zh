    Gartner identified IoT analytics as one of the two top technologies used in IoT.
  prefs: []

- en: IoT analytics is the application of data analysis tools and procedures to unlocking
    insights from the huge volumes of data generated by IoT devices in different ways.
    IoT analytics is essential for extracting insights from the data generated by
    IoT devices or things. More specifically, IoT business models analyze the information
    generated and collected by things in many ways – for example, to understand customer
    behavior, to deliver services, to improve products and services, and to identify
    and intercept business moments. The main element of most of these IoT business
    models or applications when it comes to understanding their data is an intelligent
    learning or machine learning mechanism for prediction, data mining, and pattern
    recognition. Traditional machine learning mechanisms or technologies work well
    with structured data, but they struggle with unstructured data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An example of this is Google's Nest learning thermostat, which records temperature
    data in a structured way and then applies machine learning algorithms to understand
    the patterns of its user's temperature preferences and schedules. However, it
    does not understand unstructured data, such as multimedia data, which is audio
    signals and visual images. Additionally, the training of traditional machine learning
    algorithms relies on handcrafted and engineered feature sets that may not be easy
    in many IoT applications because of heterogeneity and the dynamics involved in
    the applications. In factories, for example, faults could be random and feature
    sets might be unavailable to classify them. For this reason, IoT demands new analytics

    commands using DL.

    uses DL technology to perform tasks such as unlocking a door when it recognizes
    its user's face. DL and IoT are among the top three strategic technology trends
    for 2017, and were announced at the Gartner Symposium/ITxpo 2016\. The intensive
    publicity around DL is due to the fact that traditional machine learning algorithms
    do not address the emerging analytic needs of IoT systems. On the contrary, DL
    algorithms or models, in general, bring two important improvements over traditional
    machine learning approaches. First, they reduce the need for handcrafted and engineered
    feature sets to be used for the training of a model. As a result, some features
    in IoT applications, which might not be apparent to humans, can be extracted easily
    by DL models. Moreover, DL models improve prediction accuracy.

    fog computing devices, and end devices, is difficult because of their resource-constrained
    properties. Moreover, IoT data is different from general big data. We need to

    treatment from the analytics approach. Many IoT applications, such as remote patient
    monitoring or autonomous vehicles, generate streams of data continuously, and
    this leads to a huge volume of continuous data. Many other applications, such
    as consumer product analysis for marketing or inhabitant monitoring in forests
    or underwater, produce data that accumulates as a source of big data. Streaming
    data is generated or captured within short intervals of time and need to be quickly
    analyzed to extract immediate and useful insights and make fast decisions.

    IoT applications, such as remote patient monitoring, or driverless cars, where
    the timely aggregation of data is needed to bring all pieces of data together
    for analysis and, subsequently, to provide reliable and accurate actionable insights.

    computing systems or cloud platforms. A potential solution for streaming data
    analytics is frameworks based on data parallelism and incremental processing.
    Although these techniques may reduce time latency and return a response from the
    streaming data analytics framework, they are not the optimal solution for real-time
    IoT applications. In this context, it is better to bring streaming data analytics
    closer to the source of data, through IoT devices or edge devices, with the support
    of fog or edge computing. However, adding data analytics to IoT devices or things
