<p><span>TensorFlow has transformed the way machine learning is perceived. <em>TensorFlow Machine Learning Projects</em> teaches you how to exploit the benefits—simplicity, efficiency, and flexibility—of using TensorFlow in various real-world projects. With the help of this book, you'll not only learn how to build advanced projects using different datasets, but also be able to tackle common challenges using a range of libraries from the TensorFlow ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span>To begin with, you'll get to grips with using TensorFlow for machine learning projects. You'll explore a wide range of projects using TensorForest and TensorBoard for detecting exoplanets, TensorFlow.js for sentiment analysis, and TensorFlow Lite for digit classification.</span></p>
<p><span>As you make your way through the book, you'll build projects in various real-world domains incorporating <strong>natural language processing</strong> (<strong>NLP</strong>), the Gaussian process, autoencoders, recommender systems, and Bayesian neural networks, along with trending areas such as <strong>generative adversarial networks</strong> (<strong>GANs</strong>), capsule networks, and reinforcement learning. You'll learn to use TensorFlow with the Spark API and explore GPU-accelerated computing with TensorFlow in order to detect objects, followed by understanding how to train and develop a <strong>recurrent neural network</strong> (<strong>RNN</strong>) model to generate book scripts.</span></p>
<p><span>By the end of this book, you'll have gained the required expertise to build full-fledged machine learning projects at work.</span></p>

<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>tf.constant(<br/>  value,<br/>  dtype=None,<br/>  shape=None,<br/>  name='const_name',<br/>  verify_shape=False<br/>  )</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>const1 (x):  Tensor("x:0", shape=(), dtype=int32)</strong><br/><strong>const2 (y):  Tensor("y:0", shape=(), dtype=float32)</strong><br/><strong>const3 (z):  Tensor("z:0", shape=(), dtype=float16)</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see on screen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Type a review into the box provided and click <strong>Submit</strong> to see the model's predicted score.</span><span>"</span></p>
