- en: There is an ever-growing need for deep learning experts across the globe and
    TensorFlow is a leading framework for building deep learning applications. To
    meet the growing demand for developers with the requisite skills to build deep
    learning applications across various domains, the TensorFlow Developer Certificate
    was established. This 5-hour, hands-on exam is designed to test a developer’s
    foundational knowledge in building, training, saving, and debugging models in
    computer vision, natural language processing, time series, sequences and predictions.
